  - A relatively small or the smallest discrete portion or amount of something. Any of the basic units of matter and energy such as a molecule, atom, proton, electron, or photon.
- - Can particles be compressed?
  - There is no space between the individual particles, so they cannot pack together. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why gases are more compressible than either liquids or solids. Gases are compressible because most of the volume of a gas is composed of the large amounts of empty space between the gas particles.
- - Why are particles in solids closely packed?
  - Because the particles don't move, solids have a definite shape and volume, and can't flow. Because the particles are alreadypacked closely together, solids can't easily be compressed. Intermolecular force is less in liquid than in solid so particles of matter are close in solid than in liquid.
- - Are particles attracted to each other?
  - Particles of matter of the same substance, such as the same element, are attracted to one another. The force of attraction tends to pull the particles closer together. The particles need a lot of kinetic energy to overcome the force of attraction and move apart. It's like a tug of war between opposing forces.
- - Are particles and molecules the same?
  - Particles can be atoms, molecules or ions. The term molecule is often used incorrectly to refer to any type of chemical compound. A molecule is a neutral particle made of two or more atoms bonded together.

- - When are particles rigid and compressed?
  - Rigidity is the property which helps a substance to retain its shape when force is % applied to it. Solids are rigid while gases, and liquids are not. Compressibility means that the particles of matter can be compressed or reduced in volume by applying force or pressure. Gases are highly compressible.
- - Are particles smaller than atoms?
  - Atoms represent the smallest pieces of matter with constant properties, and are referred to as the basic unit of matter. Sub-atomic particles are even smaller than particles or atoms. These sub-atomic particles are called protons, neutrons, and electrons.
- - Why are particles in matter always moving?
  - The particles are held together too strongly to allow movement from place to place but the particles do vibrate about their position in the structure. With an increase in temperature, the particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster and more strongly.
- - When are particles closest together?
  - In a solid, the particles are very attracted to each other so they are close together. The particles can move in their fixed positions but cannot slide past one another.
- - Explain why is a solid not compressible but a gas is.
  - A-3 solids are not compressible because the molecules are tightly packed and the intermolecular space is less or is negligible but gases have a large space between the molecules that's why they are very loosely packed. Hence, are compressed to a large extent.
- - Can liquids be compressed?
  - A liquid cannot be compressed because it has a fixed volume.

- - What is the use of multiples of unit?
  - It is to deal with very large or small quantities.
- - How do we use multiples of unit?

  - The mass of a proton is 1.0073 atomic mass unit(amu).
- - Can protons be gained or lost?
  - The only two ways by which atoms lose protons is through radioactive decay and nuclear fission. Both processes will only occur in atoms that have unstable nuclei. Losing a proton from an atom does not usually occur as much as losing electrons to form ionic or covalent bonds.
- - Why protons repel each other?
  - A nucleus of many protons and no neutrons would not be stable because protons have a positive electric charge. Since charges of the same sign repel, protons repel each other in the nucleus.

  - The mass of an electron is 1/1837 atomic mass unit(amu).
- - Why do electrons become delocalised in metals?
  - Metals consist of giant structures of atoms arranged in a regular pattern. The electrons from the outer shells of the metal atoms are delocalised, and are free to move through the whole structure. This sharing of delocalised electrons results in strong metallic bonding.
- - Why are electrons attracted to the nucleus?
  - The atom's center, or nucleus, is positively charged and the electrons that whirl around this nucleus are negatively charged, so they attract each other. The reason the force is strong is because the atom is so small. The electrons are attracted to the nucleus by the electrostatic force of attraction to the protons.
- - For Lewis Structure, do I need to draw the bond angle?

  - The number of protons=atomic number=number of electrons
- - What are ions?
  - Ions are a result of transfer of electrons. The protons and neutrons are not affected.
- - Can ions dissolve in water?
  - When you immerse an ionic compound in water, the ions are attracted to the water molecules, each of which carries a polar charge. If the attraction between the ions and the water molecules is great enough to break the bonds holding the ions together, the compound dissolves.
- - Can ions be isotopes?
  - An ion is an atom that has had electrons added or removed to give an overall electric charge. It is therefore obvious that any isotope of an element can be ionised, as the number of neutrons has no effect on the electronic structure of the atom.
- - Can isotopes dissolve in water?
  - Heavier oxygen isotopes are usually more soluble in water under equilibrium conditions. This means that isotope fractionation factors between dissolved and gaseous oxygen are larger than one and their corresponding e (epsilon) values are positive.
- - Where do ions exists?
  - Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a crystal lattice. The resulting compound is called an ionic compound, and is said to be held together by ionic bonding.
- - What are isotopes?
  - Isotopes are atoms of the same particular element that may have different number of neutrons.
- - Are isotopes always radioactive?
  - There are two main types of isotopes, stable and unstable. There are 254 known stable isotopes. All artificial isotopes are unstable and therefore radioactive; scientists call them radioisotopes. Some elements can only exist in an unstable form.
- - Why is an isotope radioactive?
  - If the ratio of neutrons to protons becomes too large or the atomic number is above 83 an isotope will be radioactive. According to the theory, If the ratio of neutrons to protons more than one, or becomes too large, the isotope is radioactive or the atomic number is above 83, the isotope will be radioactive.
- - Are isotopes neutral?
  - As the number of electrons and number of neutrons are same in an isotope. Isotopes are electrically neutral.
- - How do Isotopes exist?
  - Isotopes can either form spontaneously (naturally) through radioactive decay of a nucleus or artificially by bombarding a stable nucleus with charged particles via accelerators or neutrons in a nuclear reactor.
- - What are some examples of isotopes?
  - The number of nucleons (both protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the atom's mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number. For example, carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13, and 14, respectively.
- - Are isotopes the same element?
  - Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons and electrons. The difference in the number of neutrons between the various isotopes of an element means that the various isotopes have different masses.
- - What is electronic configuration?
  - Electronic configuration is the distribution of electrons in an atom. The electrons in the outer most shell, furthest from the nucleus is called valence electrons.
- - How many types of subshells are there?
  - Within the shells, electrons are further grouped into subshells of four different types, identified as s, p, d, and f in order of increasing energy. The first shell has only an s subshell; the second shell has an s and a p subshell; the third shell has s, p, and d subshells, and the fourth has s, p, d and f subshells.
- - Are subshells and sublevels the same?
  - Each energy level, or shell, is divided into sublevels. The terms sublevel and subshell are used interchangeably. The sublevels are represented by the letters s, p, d, and f. Each energy level has certain sublevels.
- - Are Subshells the same as energy levels?
  - Energy levels are not what you described at all. Those are shells. s, p, d, and f are subshells not shells. Shells refer to collections of subshells with the same principal quantum number.
- - What are the different subshells are there?
  - Within the shells, electrons are further grouped into subshells of four different types, identified as s, p, d, and f in order of increasing energy.

- - What does the atomic mass unit measure?
  - Methane has a symmetrical shape and has no lone pair. Methane also has only carbon and hydrogen atoms in its structure. Therefore methane is a non-polar molecule.
- - What does the atomic mass unit tell us?
  - The AMU is used to express the relative masses of, and differentiate between, various isotopes of elements.
- - Why is the methane molecule CH4 non-polar?
  - There are 4 hydrogen for the central carbon, so the electrons are evenly distributed.
- - How do we tell if a molecule is polar or non-polar?
  - Non-polar molecules are either monoatomic(e.g,neon, xenon, argon, helium), di-atomic(N2,H2,O2,Cl2,F2), a molecule that only contains carbon and hydrogen atoms(e.g,CH4,CH2=CH2,C2H6), a molecule that has symmetry in its structure(o=c=o), and has a lesser than 0.5 of electronegativity value difference(e.g,Bromine mono-chloride, Iodine mono-bromide). For polar molecules it either have a hydrogen bonding(to nitrogen, oxygen, flourine,e.g,H2O, NH3, HF, CH3OH,CH3COOH), if the molecule lacks symmetry and have a polar bonding(e.g, S=C=O, EN of S is 2.5, EN of C is 2.5, EN of O is 3.5, Carbon to oxygen bond is polar, Carbon to Sulfur bond is non-polar), and if the molecule dessolve in another polar molecule.
- - What are polar and non polar molecules?
  - Polar molecules occur when there is an electronegativity difference between the bonded atoms. Nonpolar molecules occur when electrons are shared equal between atoms of a diatomic molecule or when polar bonds in a larger molecule cancel each other out.
- - Why are polar molecules more reactive?
  - When a bond is polar the species can become more reactive because it can be attacked by other species more easily i.e. a nucleophile or electrophile.
- - How does polarity affect reactivity?
  - The polarity of a molecule tells whether the electron cloud is equally distributed across the atoms within the molecule, or whether an electronegative atom is affecting the electron density. The distribution of the electrons will affect the behavior and reactivity of the molecule.
- - What determines the behavior of a polar or nonpolar molecules?
  - A molecule has polar bonds if there is a significant difference in electronegativity between the two elements. If the electronegativities of both elements are very similar or the same, the bonds are non-polar. If this is the case, the entire molecule is also non-polar.
- - Can polar molecules dissolve in nonpolar solvents?
  - Polar solvents will dissolve polar and ionic solutes because of the attraction of the opposite charges on the solvent and solute particles. Non-polar solvents will only dissolve non-polar solutes because they cannot attract the dipoles or the ions.
- - How does the polarity of molecule and solvent impact interaction?
  - If solute and solvent have approximately the same polarity, they will probably form a solution. “Like dissolves like”, Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents; nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents.
- - Do polar molecules repel each other?
  - Things that are polar can attract and repel each other (opposite charges attract, alike charges repel). The two magnets in the image above will attract because their opposite poles are near. Reverse one of them and they will repel each other. Water is a polar molecule.
- - How does polarity cause adhesion?
  - Adhesion is caused by the polarity of water. Water molecules have an uneven sharing of electrons due to covalent bonding. This creates a negative and positive end of each water molecule. This results in water being attracted to other molecules.
- - Why do nonpolar molecules have lower surface tension than polar molecules?
  - Non-polar molecules have a lower surface tension because they have lower intermolecular forces of attraction.
- - What causes adhesion and cohesion?
  - Adhesion is caused by electrostatic or mechanical forces that exist among two kinds of different substances. Cohesion is caused by hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forces.
- - Why is polarity is so important to reactivity?
  - The polarity of bonds helps us understand non-covalent forces between molecules, such as hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions. It also helps us interpret the reactivity of molecules
- - What makes water a polar molecule?
  - The unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms and the unsymmetrical shape of the molecule means that a water molecule has two poles - a positive charge on the hydrogen pole (side) and a negative charge on the oxygen pole (side). We say that the water molecule is electrically polar.
- - How does the polarity of a molecule affect its solubility?
  - Can solubility be used to identify a substance?
- - Why do polar molecules have stronger intermolecular forces?
  - The polar bond is stronger than a nonpolar bond as there is an extra force of attraction present in the polar bonds like positive and negative charges.
- - Why do fluids adhere to certain surfaces?
  - The surface tension of a liquid results from an imbalance of intermolecular attractive forces, the cohesive forces between molecules, A molecule in the bulk liquid experiences cohesive forces with other molecules in all directions. A molecule at the surface of a liquid experiences only net inward cohesive forces.
- - How do intermolecular forces affect adhesion?
  - It results when cohesive forces, the intermolecular forces in the liquid, are weaker than adhesive forces, the attraction between a liquid and the surface of the capillary. The shape of the meniscus, the upper surface of a liquid in a tube, also reflects the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces.
- - How is the strength of intermolecular forces related to the properties of liquids such as surface tension viscosity boiling point and vapor pressure?
  - Higher the intermolecular forces between the liquid particles, harder it is for it to escape into the vapor phase, or another words, you need more energy to convert it from liquid to the vapor phase, in other words, higher its boiling point.
- - Is electrostatic forces intermolecular forces?
  - Most intermolecular forces, or nonbonded forces, are electrostatic. This means that the electrostatic potentials around a molecule are a good measure of nonbonded bond strength and we can use potential maps to study nonbonded interactions.
- - Which has more intermolecular forces polar or non-polar compounds?
  - In each pair, one molecule is polar and the other is nonpolar, but otherwise they are as similar as possible. The polar substance always has the higher boiling point, indicating greater attractive forces between separate molecules, that is, larger intermolecular forces.
- - How intermolecular forces of attraction affect viscosity?
  - Intermolecular forces play a role in viscosity, because stronger attractions between molecules cause them to resist flow more strongly. Molecule size is also an important factor in viscosity because the attraction of intermolecular forces is stronger, so that they cause more friction.
- - What is viscosity?
  - The state of being thick, sticky, and semi-fluid in consistency, due to internal friction and a quantity expressing the magnitude of internal friction in a fluid, as measured by the force per unit area resisting uniform flow.
- - How does polarity affect capillary action?
  - How is polarity related to capillary action? Since water is polar, the cohesion of water causes capillary attraction, the ability of water to move uphill in small spaces. Water will move up the fibers of a plant because of cohesion. This force helps plants get the water they need to survive.
- - What determines the cohesiveness of water molecules?
  - Cohesion refers to the attraction of molecules for other molecules of the same kind, and water molecules have strong cohesive forces thanks to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with one another.
- - Does more polar mean higher boiling point?
  - The polar substance always has the higher boiling point, indicating greater attractive forces between separate molecules, that is, larger intermolecular forces.
- - Do polar or nonpolar molecules evaporate faster?
  - Less-polar molecules should evaporate faster because they are not as attracted to each other.
- - What's the relationship between polarity and boiling point?
  - The greater the forces of attraction the higher the boiling point or the greater the polarity the higher the boiling point.
- - Why do polar liquids evaporate slower?
  - Polar liquids are slower to evaporate than nonpolar liquids. Polar molecules are attracted to adjacent molecules and are therefore less able to escape from the liquid's surface than are nonpolar molecules.
- - Why does alcohol evaporate faster than water?
  - The reason for the difference is hydrogen bonding, and water's much higher heat of vaporization than alcohol. Because of hydrogen bonds, the water molecules aren't evaporating.
- - What is the meaning of a dipole moment?
  - Dipole moments arise from differences in electronegativity. The larger the difference in electronegativity, the larger the dipole moment.
- - Why does water have stronger intermolecular forces than ethanol?
  - Hydrogen bonding is stronger in water than in ethanol. Positive H complements the negative electron pairs in O and, thus, forming a stronger intermolecular force. Water needs higher energy to break those bonds. Hence, water has higher boiling point at same atmospheric pressure than ethanol.
- - Which substance has the strongest intermolecular forces?
  - Water has the strongest intermolecular forces of all the substances used.
- - Why does water have the strongest intermolecular forces?
  - A property of water is that it has strong intermolecular forces as a result of hydrogen bonding and the dipole moments created by the strong electronegative oxygen and the hydrogen.
- - What is the difference between polar and nonpolar molecules in terms of attraction forces?
  - Polar molecules differ from nonpolar molecules by having positive and negative ends and stronger intermolecular forces of attraction. A polar molecule such as water has a negative end and two positive ends. The charged end of one molecule is attracted to the oppositely charged end in a neighbouring molecule.
- - What intermolecular force causes attraction between non polar substances?
  - The intermolecular force of attraction between non-polar molecules is called dispersion force. Another term for dispersion force is London dispersion force.
- - Which molecules have the strongest intermolecular forces?
  - Ion-dipole forces are the strongest of the intermolecular forces. Hydrogen bonding is a specific term for a particularly strong dipole-dipole interaction between a hydrogen atom and a very electronegative atom (oxygen, fluorine, or nitrogen). However, hydrogen bonds are still not as strong as ion-dipole interactions.
- - What is a dipole moment?
  - A dipole moment is the turning force a fixed charge has on a dipole in a molecule. The moment depends on the charge at the end of the dipole and its distance from the charge at the other end of the dipole.
- - Where can a dipole-dipole interaction happen?
  - Dipole–dipole forces occur between molecules with permanent dipoles. For molecules of similar size and mass, the strength of these forces increases with increasing polarity.
- - Why does the strength of London Dispersion force increase when the molecule size increase?
  - It is because larger and heavier molecules have stronger dispersion forces than smaller and lighter ones. In a larger molecule or atom, the valence electrons are further apart to the nucleus.They are less tightly held and can more easily form temporary dipoles. The ease with which the electron distribution around an atom or molecule can be distorted is called the polarizability.
- - What type of molecules are London Dispersion forces present?
  - Dispersion forces are present between all molecules, whether they are polar or nonpolar. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces than smaller and lighter ones.
- - What are di-atomic molecules?
  - Diatomic molecules are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements.
- - Are diatomic molecules compounds?
  - It is not a compound because it is made from atoms of only one element - oxygen. This type of molecule is called a diatomic molecule, a molecule made from two atoms of the same type.
- - Is the boiling point of diatomic molecules different than that of their individual atoms?
  - Individual atoms and molecules cannot boil. Boiling is a bulk property. As others have observed, if a molecular substance is stable enough to have a boiling point, the atomization temperature will be far above that point.
- - What are some examples of di-atomic molecules?
  - There are seven elements that occur naturally as homonuclear diatomic molecules. All of these molecules are in the gaseous state. Five of these elements - hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), fluorine (F2), and chlorine (Cl2) - occur as diatomic elements at room temperature, which is 25 degrees Celsius.
- - What is the meaning of polar and non-polar molecules?
  - A polar molecule has atoms with different electronegativity, and there are nett dipole moments. Polarity is dependent on the electronegativity of the atoms in the molecule.
- - What is the difference between polar and non-polar molecules?
  - Polar molecules have a uniform distribution of electron density. A nonpolar molecule results from an unequal distribution of electron density. Polar compounds are arranged asymmetrically. They have polar bonds that are symmetrical.
- - What is the meaning of a nett dipole moment?
  - dipole moments are applied to the distribution of electrons between two bonded atoms. The existence of a dipole moment is the difference between polar and nonpolar bonds. Molecules with a net dipole moment are polar molecules.
- - How nett dipole moment occur?
  - Dipole moments occur when there is a separation of charge. They can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond; dipole moments arise from differences in electronegativity. The larger the difference in electronegativity, the larger the dipole moment.
- - Is nett dipole moment the same as electronegativity?
  - Dipole moments occur when there is a separation of charge. They can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond; dipole moments arise from differences in electronegativity. Therefore, they are not the same as dipole moment arises from when there is a difference in electronegativity.
- - How do I tell if a molecule has a nett dipole moment?
  - The dipole moment is calculated by multiplying the distance between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms by the difference in their charge.  If the individual bond dipole moments cancel one another(o), there is no net dipole moment.
- - How do I identify for nett dipole moment or dipole-dipole moment?
  - The dipole moment of a molecule can be predicted by looking at the molecule's structure and the location of the dipoles within the molecule. When a molecule has no dipole moment, it will be nonpolar. A molecule with a dipole moment will be polar

  - Molecules can have hydrogen bonding if Nitrogen, flourine, or oxygen are present. Example, CH3COOH(oxygen atom is directly connected to hydrogen atom).
- - Are hydrogen bonds dipole dipole?
  - Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom. It results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as a N, O, or F atom and another very electronegative atom.

- - What is the Stock or Classical method of naming compounds?
  - Ionic compounds are named by stating the cation first, followed by the anion. Positive and negative charges must balance. Some anions have multiple forms and are named accordingly with the use of roman numerals in parentheses.
- - What is the meaning of parentheses?
  - a word or phrase inserted as an explanation or afterthought into a passage which is grammatically complete without it, in writing usually marked off by brackets, dashes, or commas.
- - What is the difference between molar mass and relative molecular mass?
  - Molecular mass of a compound is defined as the mass of one molecule. Molecular mass differs because of the isotopes. The unit in which molecular mass is measured is amu. However, It is defined as the mass of substance for a given amount. The SI unit of molar mass is g/mol.
- - When do we use the term relative molecular mass or relative formula mass?
  - The relative molecular mass of a molecule is the average mass of one molecule of that element or compound compared to 1/12 of the mass of one carbon-12 atom. Relative molecular mass is also a ratio and therefore has no unit. It is used for colavent molecules. Relative formula mass are used for larger molecules like ionic compounds. The way it is calculated is exactly the same way you calculate relative molecular mass.
- - How do I calculate the relative molecular mass?
  - The relative molecular mass is defined as the weighted mean mass of a molecule compared with 1/12th the mass of an atom of carbon-12. It has the symbol of Mr. To calculate, you simply add up all the relative atomic masses of the atoms in the molecule. Example, C2H4Cl2, (2 x C) + (4 x H) + (2 x Cl), (2 x 12.0) + (4 x 1) + (2 x 35.5) = Mr = 99.0. Relative molecular mass applies to one molecular therefore the number used is not large.

- - What are ionic bonds?
  - Ionic bonds are formed when metals react wiith non-metals. An electrostatic attraction is formed as a result of transfer of electrons from one atom or group of atoms to another.
- - When do ionic bonds occur?
  - An ionic bond can be formed after two or more atoms loss or gain electrons to form an ion. Ionic bonds occur between metals, losing electrons, and nonmetals, gaining electrons. Ions with opposite charges will attract one another creating an ionic bond.
- - What is electrostatic means?
  - Electrostatic attraction is what you get between oppositely charged ions in a giant ion lattice, e.g. NaCl, where the Na+ and Cl- ions are attracted to one another. Electrostatic attraction is not an intermolecular force, as it is not between molecules.
- - What does it means by electrostatic attraction?
  - Electrostatic attraction is what you get between oppositely charged ions in a giant ion lattice, e.g. NaCl, where the Na+ and Cl- ions are attracted to one another. Electrostatic attraction is not an intermolecular force, as it is not between molecules.
- - What are covalent bonds?
  - Covalent bonds are formed by sharing electrons between non-metallic atoms. They share their valence electrons to gain a stable. Has a strong electrostatic attraction between +ve nuclei and shared electron pair.
- - How do covalent bonds occur?
  - A covalent bond consists of the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons between two atoms. These electrons are simultaneously attracted by the two atomic nuclei. A covalent bond forms when the difference between the electronegativities of two atoms is too small for an electron transfer to occur to form ions.
- - What are metallic bonds?
  - Metallic bonding arises from the electrostatic attractive force between conduction electrons and positively charged metal ions. They become delocalised in the presence of other metal atoms and forms negatively charged free-electron cloud.
- - How do metallic bonds form?
  - Metallic bonds are formed when the charge is spread over a larger distance as compared to the size of single atoms in solids. Because metals are solid, their atoms are tightly packed in a regular arrangement.
- - Do metallic bonds have intermolecular forces?
  - An intramolecular force is the force that holds the atoms or ions together in a compound. Intramolecular forces are much stronger than intermolecular forces (the forces that act between discrete molecules). The physical properties of metals are dependent on strong intramolecular forces metallic bonding.
- - Are metallic bonds stronger than ionic bond?
  - The metallic bond is somewhat weaker than the ionic and covalent bond. Ionic bonds are strong electrostatic attraction forces formed between positive and negative ions. This bond is non-directional, meaning that the pull of the electrons does not favor one atom over another.
- - What does the Lewis structure show?
  - It is to represent the covalent bonding, shows the geometry around the central atom, and the lone pairs on the central atom represented as dots.
- - Why is the shape important in chemistry?
  - It Influences the physical properties of the compound like boiling point and solubility.
- - Can solubility be used to identify a substance?
  - The solubility of a substance is a characteristic property that can help identify the substance. The process of dissolving takes place at the molecular level. The substance being dissolved is called the solute and the liquid doing the dissolving is called the solvent.
- - Is solubility enough to identify compounds?
  - Some properties, such as solubility, melting point, boiling point, and density are independent of the amount of substance being examined. These properties are known as intensive properties and are used to identify a substance.
- - What are the uses of solubility?
  - The solubility curve helps us to predict which substance will crystallize out first from a solution containing two or more solutes. The solubility curve helps us to compare the solubilities of different substances at the same temperature.
- - What is meant by the solubility of a substance?
  - Solubility is defined as the maximum amount of a substance that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specified temperature.
- - What does VSEPR stands for?
  - VSEPR is an acronym that stands for valence shell electron pair repulsion. The model was proposed by Nevil Sidgwick and Herbert Powell in 1940. Ronald Gillespie and Ronald Nyholm then developed the model into their theory published in 1957; they are considered the developers of the VSEPR theory.
- - What does VSEPR means?
  - It means that it considers the distribution of bonding and non-bonding electrons around the molecule in the 3-D space and that only the valence shell electrons are involved.
- - When is VSEPR applied?
  - The VSEPR theory can be applied to each resonance structure of a molecule. The strength of the repulsion is strongest in two lone pairs and weakest in two bond pairs. If electron pairs around the central atom are closer to each other, they will repel each other.
- - How is VSEPR applied?
  - The valence-shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory states that electron pairs repel each other whether or not they are in bond pairs or in lone pairs. Thus, electron pairs will spread themselves as far from each other as possible to minimize repulsion. VSEPR focuses not only on electron pairs, but it also focus on electron groups as a whole.
- - Why are electron pairs arranged far apart from one another?
  - Electron pairs are arranged as far apart from one another to minimize repulsion between one another as electrons are of the same charge.
- - Why do electron pair repel one another?
  - Electron pairs are arranged as far apart from one another to minimize repulsion between one another as electrons are of the same charge.
- - Are electron pairs far apart?
  - Electron pairs are arranged as far apart from one another to minimize repulsion between one another as electrons are of the same charge.
- - what are the purpose of lone pair of electrons?
  - The presence of a lone pair decreases the bond angle between the bonding pair of electrons, due to their high electric charge, which causes great repulsion between the electrons. They are also involved in the formation of a dative bond.
- - Do lone electrons form covalent bonds?
  - Covalent bonds form when electrons in two atoms form overlapping orbitals. Lone pair electrons in an atom are not shared with another atom.
- - Are lone pairs of electrons used for bonding?
  - Lone pairs of electrons are not used in covalent bondings.
- - What are the geometrical shapes for 2,3, and 4 bond pairs?
  - Linear for 2 bond pairs at 180 degrees bond angle, trigonal planar for 3 bond pairs at 120 degrees bond angle, and tetrahedral for 4 bond pairs at 109.5 degree bond angle(all with no lone pairs).
- - What if there are lone pairs around the central atom?
  - Lone pairs are closer to the nucleus than bonding pairs, and exert a greater repulsive force. They repel each other more than the repulsion between bond pairs. Lone-pair bond pair has a greater repulsion that of bond-pair bond pair. Because the lone pair repel the bond pair, the bond angle N-H is compressed.
- - why are electrons unequally shared between atoms?
  - One atom has a greater ability to pull the bonding electrons towards it and is said to be more electronegative.
- - What does electronegativity means?
  - Ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electron to itself. Elements that are further on the right side of the periodic table have a higher electronegativity. Elements that are on the far left of the periodic table have a lower electronegativity. A higher difference in electronegativity means a higher polarity between the bonds.
- - How is electronegativity measured?
  - Electronegativity is measured using the pauling scale.
- - Why is electronegativity important?
  - Because atoms do not exist in isolation and instead form molecular compounds by combining with other atoms, the concept of electronegativity is important because it determines the nature of bonds between atoms.
- - What does electronegativity affects?
  - The electronegativity of an element affects the bonding of an element. Elements with high electronegativity tend to form ionic bonds with other elements.
- - Does electronegativity affect bond strength?
  - Chemical bonds generally become stronger as the electronegativity difference between their participating atoms increases. The more equal the sharing the stronger the bond. If the electronegativities of the two atoms are completely the same, the bond formed by the sharing of the electrons will be a pure covalent bond.
- - What is polarity and why is it important in bonding?
  - A polar molecule is one that possesses a nett dipole moment. Polarity determines the type of intermolecular forces between its molecules. Therefore, the physical properties like boiling point and solubility.
- - Are diatomic molecules polar?
  - All diatomic molecules with the same element are non-polar.All diatomic molecules with different elements are polar (since there is a nett dipole moment).
- - why do diatomic elements exist?
  - A monatomic element is stable with just one atom. These diatomic elements are most stable in this paired form because it allows them to follow the octet rule. This means that generally there are not single atoms of oxygen or chlorine floating around.
- - Do diatomic molecules have covalent bonds?
  - In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the bonding is covalent. Each atom in the molecule has equal electronegativity; electrons are shared equally between the two atoms. In heteronuclear diatomic molecules, the atoms differ in electronegativity; these molecules have polar covalent bonds.
- - Why is CO2/carbon dioxide non-polar?
  - O=C=O is the structure of carbon dioxide. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore the shared electron will be pulled towards the oxygen. However, there are 2 oxygen atoms and causing the dipole moment to be cancelled and no nett dipole moment. Thus, Carbon dioxide is non-polar.
- - What are london Dispersion forces?
  - It operates between all molecules and increases in strength with increasing molecular weight. It has the weakest amongst the intermolecular forces.
- - What does the london Dispersion forces affect?
  - London forces are the attractive forces that cause nonpolar substances to condense to liquids and to freeze into solids when the temperature is lowered sufficiently.
- - How does the london Dispersion forces occur?
  - The London dispersion force is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy positions that make the atoms form temporary dipoles.
- - What are dipole-dipole forces?
  - Exist between neutral polar molecules  with permanent dipoles, when the positive end of one molecule is near the negative end of another. For molecules of approximately equal mass and size, the strengths of dipole-dipole forces increase with increasing polarity.
- - What are hydrogen bonds?
  - It is a type of intermolecular attraction that exists between the hydrogen atom in a polar bond. It is the strongest amongst the intermolecular forces.
- - Why is hydrogen bonding the strongest?
  - Hydrogen bonding is so strong among dipole-dipole interactions because it itself is a dipole-dipole interaction with one of the strongest possible electrostatic attractions.
- - How are hydrogen bonds formed?
  - Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom. It results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as a N, O, or F atom and another very electronegative atom.
- - How does binding energy vary with mass number?
  - Binding energy per nucleon is obtained by dividing the binding energy with mass number and is the measure of the stability of nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon is less for lighter nuclides and increase with the mass number. Thus, the binding energy per nucleon decreases with increase in the mass number.
- - What does binding energy means?
  - It is the energy required to create or break a bond.
- - How does binding energy increase?
  - When protons and neutrons react together making bonds, they give up energy nuclear binding energy. The binding energy must increase with the number of nucleons because to get more together, they must collectively give up a large amount of energy.
- - Does a higher binding energy affect the physical properties of the molecule?
  - Increase in binding energy means a stronger bond, a higher amount of thermal energy to overcome the bonds, which will result in higher melting and boiling points of the molecule.
- - Which type of bonding have the highest binding energy required to break the bond?
  - Ionic bond has the highest binding energy at 625-1550 KJ/mol, followed by covalent bond at 520-1250 KJ/mol, followed by metallic bond at 100-800 KJ/mol, and lastly Van der Waals forces at less than 40 KJ/mol.
- - Why do ionic compounds have a higher boiling point?
  - Ionic bonds have strong electrostatic force between the oppositely charged ions. It requires higher amounts of thermal energy to break the bonds.
- - Do ionic bonds have high ionization energy?
  - Elements having low ionisation energies have a more favourable chance to form a cation, thereby having a greater tendency to form ionic bonds. Thus, lower ionization energy of metallic elements favours the formation of an ionic bond.
- - What are the effects of polarity, molecular weight, and hydrogen bond?
  - The higher the polarity, the higher dipole-dipole forces which will result in higher boiling points. The higher the molecular weight, the higher the boiling point of the molecule. If a hydrogen bonding is present, the boiling point of the molecule will be abnormally high/large.

  - Stoichiometry is founded on the law of conservation of mass where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products, leading to the insight that the relations among quantities of reactants and products typically form a ratio of positive integers.
- - Does stoichiometry affect rate of reaction?
  - Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the amount of each substance affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the reaction.
- - What does stoichiometric amount mean?
  - A stoichiometric amount of one reactant can mean the amount that will react completely with a given amount of another reactant, leaving no excess of either one.

  - A pipette is a laboratory instrument used to measure out or transfer small quantities of liquid, in volumes of milliliters (mL), microliters (μL).
- - What is a burette?
  - The burette is used to measure the volume of a dispensed substance, but is different from a measuring cylinder as its graduations measure from top to bottom. Therefore, the difference between the starting and the final volume is equal to the amount dispensed.
- - When do we use pipette and burette or individually?
  - They both have gradations to measure the quantity of chemical substances. While burette is used to deliver a chemical solution with a known concentration into a flask, pipette is used to measure the quantity of the analyte- the chemical substrate whose concentration is to be determined.

- - How do I read the readings of the burette?
  - For a single burette reading, the second decimal place is an estimation and should only be a 0 or a 5. This means that we can read the precision of a burette up to 2 decimal places. In order to obtain the volume of liquid dispensed (or delivered) into the holding glassware, we take the difference in the initial. (Volume of liquid dispensed = Final burette reading – initial burette reading)

- - How do I set the burette?
  - Firstly, clamp burette vertically on the retort stand. This is to eliminate parallax error when burette is slanted. Secondly, remove air bubble from tip of burette. This is because, air bubble must be removed prior to actual titration. If not, it may only be ejected during actual titration. This will cause thee final volume reading will be larger than expected. Lastly, remove filter funnel from burette as small amounts of solution will remain in the filter funnel and it may flow into the burette when the titration is on-going. The final volume reading will be smaller than expected.

- - Can a solute dissolve faster?
  - Breaking a solute into smaller pieces increases its surface area and increases its rate of solution. Stirring the liquid and solid solutes, brings fresh portions of the solvent in contact with the solute. Stirring, therefore, allows the solute to dissolve faster.
- - Do all solutes dissolve in water?
  - Solutes dissolved in water (solvent) are called aqueous solutions. Not all substances are soluble in water.
- - When do solutions become saturated?
  - When the solution equilibrium point is reached and no more solute will dissolve, the solution is said to be saturated. A saturated solution is a solution that contains the maximum amount of solute that is capable of being dissolved.
- - How do I make a dilution?
  - To make a dilution, the desired volume of “concentrated” solution is transferred using a pipette to a second volumetric flask.  After the stock solution has been transferred to a second volumetric flask, the procedure for topping up solvent to the line is prepare a stock solution of a specific volume and molarity by dissolving an appropriate amount of the specified solute.  The mass of the solute will be measured by the use of an analytical balance, while the volume of solution will be measured using a volumetric flask.  To prepare a solution using a volumetric flask, you first place your solute sample into a clean flask of the desired volume. Enough amount of solvent is then added.  The flask is then capped and gently shaken to dissolve the solute.

- - What is La Chatalier's principle?
  - Le Chȃtelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect that a stress like changing concentration has on a reaction system at equilibrium. If the concentration of a reaction species is increased (at constant T and V), the equilibrium system will shift in the direction that reduces the concentration of that species. The equilibrium will shift either to the left or right of the reversible reaction.
- - Why doesn't the equilibrium system shift toward the direction of the concentration If the concentration of a reaction species is increased, the equilibrium system will shift in the direction that reduces the concentration of that species?

- - What is the effect of temperature decrease or increase on La Chatalier's prinicple on the chemical reaction?
  - Ifthe temperature is increased, the position of equilibrium moves in the direction of the endothermic reaction. if the temperature is reduced, the position of equilibrium moves in the direction of the exothermic reaction.
- - What is the effect of the presence of a catalyst on La Chatalier's prinicple on the chemical reaction?
  - Catalysts do not affect the position of an equilibrium; they help reactions achieve equilibrium faster. Le Châtelier's principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts to counteract the change to reestablish an equilibrium.
- - How to predict the direction of equilibrium shifts?
  - If the concentration of reactants increase, the equilibrium will shift to the opposite side of the reaction which is the product. If equilibrium shift to the left, the concentration of the products are increased.
- - What happens when we remove products?
  - If we remove the products, the principle predicts that the system will do the opposite. Therefore, shifting to the right will produce more of the products.
- - What will happen if we add more products?
  - If the reaction product is C and D for example, and that we continue to add them into the reaction, the principle of Le Chatalier will predict that the system wants to counteract the reaction by removing the products by shifting equilibrium to the left which will remove the excess C and D.
- - What happens if the system has large amount of gaseous molecules?
  - If the system has large amount of gaseous molecules, the pressure of the system will increase which causes a shift of equilibrium to the side of the reaction with the fewer number of moles of gas and vice-versa if there is too little gaseous molecules.
- - Does the pressure increases or decreases if the amount of gaseous molecules increase in liquid or solid reactions?
  - Changes in pressure is only for the reaction that involves gases as reactants or products.
- - If there are other products(solids or liquid) formed in the reaction that invloves gases only, what do I do with the calculations?
  - You would excludethese molecules from the calculation of moles of gas molecules. Only count the gas molecules.
- - How do I change the temperature of the reaction?
  - Changing the temperature can be done by heating or cooling the reactants or products causing the equilibrium to shift left or right.
- - What does endothermic reaction means?
  - Endothermic reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings. Delta H = Positive value
- - What does exothermic reaction means?
  - Exothermic reaction releases heat to the surrounding. Delta H = negative value
- - How do we check for the type of reaction? Exothermic or endothermic?
  - Using a thermometer or thermostat. When placing a thermometer into the beaker, a exothermic reaction would indicate an increase of temperature from the initial temperature measured. An endothermic reaction will be vice-versa.
- - Why does an exothermic reaction increases the temperature?
  - The reaction of the reactants produces net energy which the molecules in the reaction could not absorb. Thus, the excess energy will be absorbed by the surrounding which causes an increase in temperature.
- - Why does an endothermic reaction decreases the temperature?
  - The reaction of the reactants requires energy which the reaction could not supply. Therefore, the alternative way for the reaction to absorb energy for the reaction is through the atmosphere or environment causing a drop in temperature.
- - What happens to the reaction with the addition of a catalyst?
  - The value of Kc is unchanged, as will the position of equilibrium. Catalyst only affects the rate of reaction.
- - What are graduated marks?
  - A thin ring etched into the neck of a volumetric flask to mark its measured capacity.
- - How to reduce errors?
  - calibrating the instrument according to manufacturers’ specifications or through regular maintenance. Random errors can be reduced by taking repeated measurements or averages to improve the precision (reduce the difference between them). Doing a “crude” and a larger number of “accurate” titration is a good example.
- - How do I find the average value of titre volume?
  - First, add the value of numbers from the amount of times you took to measure the titre volume. Then, divide the added number by the total number of times that you measure the titre volume. Finally, leave the answer in 2 decimal places.

  - It is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. Salt water is homogeneous because the dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire salt water sample.
- - What is parallax error and how it can be avoided?
  - Parallax error happens when the measurement of the length of an object is more/less than the actual length of an object. This is basically an error that happens due to the wrong positioning of the eye during measurement especially at an angle to that of the device markings.

  - M = Number of moles of solute / Volume in litres , MiVi = MfVf
- - How to properly use the mass balance?
  - Turn the balance on by pressing the control bar. The display light up for several seconds, then reset to 0.0000 by pressing on the “Tare” button. Place a weighing boat on the balance pan. Press the control bar to cancel out the weight of the weighing boat. The display will again read 0.0000. Carefully weigh mass of solid sample to the nearest of 0.0001 g. Close the glass doors and wait until the reading stabilized. Record mass of the solid sample.
- - How to ensure that my results are as accurate as possible?
  - Ensure the beaker is dry and clean before weighing. Ensure the salt is completely dissolved before transferring.Rinse beaker, stirring rod and funnel 3 times. Avoid parallax error when topping up to the mark of volumetric flask with deionised water.Use a dropper for fine adjustment. Rinse pipette with stock solution 3 times . Homogenise the solutions by inverting volumetric flask 3 times.
- - How does a hygroscopic compound affect the results of the experiment?
  - Hygroscopy is the phenomenon of attracting and holding water molecules via either absorption or adsorption from the surrounding environment. This will affect the concentration of the reactants and therefore give an inaccurate answer or value.
- - What is the meaning of pure in inorganic chemistry?
  - A pure substance consists only of one element or one compound. A mixture consists of two or more different substances, not chemically joined together.

- - What happens to the equilibrium when H+ is present under acidic conditions?
  - According to Le Chatelier's Principle, under acidic conditions, the presence of H+ shifts the equilibrium to the left.
- - What happens to the equilibrium when sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction mixture?
  - The addition of sodium hydroxide to the reaction mixture removes H+, shifting the equilibrium to the right.

  - Erlenmeyer flask is essentially the same as conical flask.
- - When is Erlenmeyer flask used?
  - The flask is often used for stirring or heating solutions and is purposefully designed to be useful for those tasks.
- - What is an autotitrator?
  - An autotitrator is also used to perform titrations. The autotitrator is semi-automated, increases efficiency and provides a more accurate result compared to a conventional glass burette/pipette titration.
- - How do I convert units to the required units?
  - Using prefixes to change the units, for example, 1kg = 1000g. Using the conversion rate, you can find the desired units of the question.
- - How do I find the number of valence electrons?
  - For neutral atoms, the number of valence electrons is equal to the atom's main group number. The main group number for an element can be found from its column on the periodic table. Exmple,Carbon is in group 4 and has 4 valence electrons, oxygen is in group 6 and has 6 valence electrons.
- - How do I find the number of unpaired electrons?
  - We have to find the atomic number of the element then write the configuration in the ground state, then according to the oxidation state subtract the number of electrons from the outer shell.
- - Which have a higher bond polarity? C-F or O-F/ Carbon-Oxygen bond or Oxygen-flourine bond?
  - Carbon-Flourine bond have a higher bond polarity as their electronegativity difference is higher than Oxygen-Fluorine bond.
- - What is solution stoichiometry?
  - It is defined as the moles of a substance contained in one liter of solution. For instance, if a solution has a concentration of 1.20 M NaCl, this means that there are 1.20 moles of NaCl per liter of solution.
- - What is the purpose of solution stoichiometry?
  - Determine amounts of reactants or products in aqueous solutions.
- - Why is solution stoichiometry significant?
  - Stoichiometry is important because it shows the relative amount of each reactant needed for a reaction to proceed, and helps determine the expected.

  - Electrolytes conduct electric current when in solution or melted. Non-electrolytes do not conduct electric current when in solution or melted.
- - What should be the solution concentration units?
  - Molarity is the most common concentration unit. It is a measure of the number of moles of solute in one liter of solution. Molarity measurements are denoted by the capital letter M with units of moles/Liter. This shows the number of moles of solute dissolved in a liquid to make one liter of solution.
- - What does variable composition mean?
  - A mixture is a substance with a variable composition, meaning that it is composed of molecules or atoms of differing types. These may have intermolecular bonds, or bonds between molecules, but such bonds are not nearly as strong as those formed when elements bond to form a compound.
- - Why do the solute in a solution does not separate or form a seperate layer after a period of time?
  - A solution is uniform, or homogeneous, throughout the mixture. It is stable and doesn't change over time or settle. The solute particles are so small they cannot be separated by filtering.
- - Why is solubility independent of the initial amounts of solute/solvent and how vigorous the stirring is?
  - Stirring affects how quickly a solute dissolves in a solvent, but has no effect on how much solute will dissolve. The amount of solute that will dissolve is affected by temperature and more will dissolve at higher temperatures. This is called the solubility of the solute.
- - Why do polar substances tend to dissolve in other polar substances?
  - Polar solvents will dissolve polar and ionic solutes because of the attraction of the opposite charges on the solvent and solute particles. Non-polar solvents will only dissolve non-polar solutes because they cannot attract the dipoles or the ions.
- - Why is pressure directly proportional to solubility?
  - The solubility is a measure of the concentration of the dissolved gas particles in the liquid and is a function of the gas pressure. As you increase the pressure of a gas, the collision frequency increases and thus the solubility goes up, as you decrease the pressure, the solubility goes down.
- - Why does the solubility of gases in liquids decreases with increasing temperature?
  - Adding heat to the solution provides thermal energy that overcomes the attractive forces between the gas and the solvent molecules, thereby decreasing the solubility of the gas. The phenomenon is similar to that involved in the increase in the vapour pressure of a pure liquid with increasing temperature.
- - Can gas molecules escape liquid solvents?
  - Energy of gas molecules increases with increasing temperature and it’s more likely for the gas molecules to escape from the liquid solvent at higher temperatures.
- - Why does the solubility of solids in liquids increases with increasing temperature?
  - The addition of more heat facilitates the dissolving reaction by providing energy to break bonds in the solid. This is the most common situation where an increase in temperature produces an increase in solubility for solids.This is because, with an increase in temperature, the space between molecules of liquid increases. Thus there is a more empty space for a solid molecule to accommodate. Thus solubility of solid solute increases in a liquid solvent.
- - Are electrolytes the same as ions?
  - Substances whose solutions conduct electricity are called electrolytes. All soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes. They conduct very well because they provide a plentiful supply of ions in solution. Some polar covalent compounds are also strong electrolytes.
- - What are some examples of non-electrolytes?
  - Molecular compounds except acids & bases are examples of non-electrolytes. Alcohol, Benzene, Cholorform, Naphthalene, Toluene, Acetone, Carbon tetrachloride.
- - How do I find the density of solution?
  - Density of solution = Mass of solution / Vol of solution
- - How do I find number of moles from molarity?
  - No. of moles = Concentration (mol/L) x Volume (L)
- - What is a precipitate?
  - Chemical precipitation, formation of a separable solid substance from a solution, either by converting the substance into an insoluble form or by changing the composition of the solvent to diminish the solubility of the substance in it.
- - How is precipitate is formed in a chemical reaction?
  - A precipitate is a solid formed in a chemical reaction that is different from either of the reactants. This can occur when solutions containing ionic compounds are mixed and an insoluble product is formed. The identity of the precipitate can often be determined by examining solubility rules.
- - can a precipitate be soluble?
  - By examining the solubility rules we see that, while most sulfates are soluble, barium sulfate is not. Because it is insoluble in water we know that it is the precipitate. As all of the other substances are soluble in water we can rewrite the equation.
- - What does equilibria means?
  - It is a state of balance between opposing forces or actions.
- - Can equilibrium constant be negative?
  - Constant of a chemical reaction equals two longer to expand into power by negative delta G, divided by R. T. And as we know, exponents, cannot be negative, so exponent of function FX is above 04, all values of acts so therefore equilibrium constant cannot B negative.
- - What is a catalyst?
  - A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction, or lowers the temperature or pressure needed to start one, without itself being consumed during the reaction.
- - How does a catalyst lower activation energy?
  - A catalyst can lower the activation energy for a reaction by orienting the reacting particles in such a way that successful collisions are more likely and reacting with the reactants to form an intermediate that requires lower energy to form the product.
- - How does the amount of collisions increase the reaction rate?
  - Collision theory states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the number of collisions between reactant molecules. The more often reactant molecules collide, the more often they react with one another, and the faster the reaction rate.
- - What if you have a order of reaction of zero?
  - So if you have a reaction order of Zero, this basically means that the concentration of the reactants does not affect the rate of reaction. You could remove or add reactants to the mixture but the rate will not change.
- - What is the definition of reaction rate?
  - Reaction rate is expressed as the change in concentration of a product or reactant over change in time.
- - When does a reversible reaction reach equilibrium?
  - If the rate of the forward reaction is less than the rate of the reverse reaction, there is a net conversion of products to reactants. If the two rates are equal, the reaction is at equilibrium.
- - Can the forward and reverse reactions are taking place at the same rate?
  - When the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, the overall amounts of reactants and products stays the same. When this balance is reached, we say that the reaction has reached equilibrium. At equilibrium, both reactants and products are present.
- - Does the equilibrium constant change with volume?
  - Because there is an equal number of moles on both sides of the reaction, an increase in volume will have no effect on the equilibrium and thus there is no shift in the direction. Similarly, when you decrease the volume there is no effect on the equilibrium.
- - Why does pressure affect boiling point?
  - The boiling point of a liquid is directly affected by atmospheric pressure. This is the pressure exerted by the weight of the air molecules above the liquid. In an open system this is called atmospheric pressure. The greater the pressure, the more energy required for liquids to boil, and the higher the boiling point.
- - Does endothermic break bonds?
  - The amount of energy change in a reaction depends on the amount of bonds broken and formed. Bond breaking is an endothermic process, because it requires energy. Bond forming is an exothermic process, because it releases energy.
- - Can exothermic reactions be spontaneous?
  - If a reaction is exothermic ( H is negative) and the entropy S is positive (more disorder), the free energy change is always negative and the reaction is always spontaneous.
- - What is ionic equilibrium?
  - In Ionic equilibrium, the ionic substance dissociates into its ions in polar solvents. The ions formed are always in equilibrium with their undissociated solute in the solution.
- - What is the difference between ionic equilibrium and chemical equilibrium?
  - The difference between chemical and ionic equilibrium is in chemical equilibrium the equilibrium is between chemical reactants and products while in ionic equillibrium the equilibrium is between the unionized molecules and ions in an electrolyte.
- - What is degree of dissociation in ionic equilibrium?
  - It can be easily described in terms of the fraction of reactant molecules that actually dissociate to achieve equilibrium in a sample. This fraction is called the degree of dissociation. For the reaction in the previous example. A(g)⇌2B(g) the degree of dissociation can be used to fill out an ICE table.
- - What are monoprotic acids?
  - A monoprotic acid is an acid that can donate only one proton, while polyprotic acid can donate more than one proton.

  - Ions present in a neutral solution is when [OH]- and [H]+ are both equal to each other.
- - What are the units for pH?
  - Ph has no units and is represented as a value between 0 to 14. values that are less than 7 are acidic and values that are more than 7 are alkaline.
- - How does the pH scale work?
  - pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 - 14, with 7 being neutral. pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water.
- - What causes the ph of a solution to increase?
  - The rise in OH− ion concentration causes the pH of the solution to increase.
- - How can the ph of a solution be measured?
  - The most common method is a pH meter, which involves a pH-sensitive electrode (usually made of glass) and a reference electrode. Acid-base indicators change color in response to different pH values. Litmus paper and pH paper are used for quick, relatively imprecise measurements.
- - Can the ph of a solution be zero or negative?
  - Negative pH is possible and simple to calculated, but not something you can easily measure. Special electrodes are used to assess extremely low pH values. In addition to negative pH, it's also possible for pH to have a value of 0.
- - Why do bases feels slippery or soapy on the skin?
  - Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the saponification of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin. Alkalis are normally water-soluble, although some like barium carbonate are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.
- - Why do bases have a bitter taste?
  - Near all if not all bitter bases are organic compounds with basic groups containing nitrogen, like aminogroups or heterocyclic nitrogen. They are often potentially poisonous alkaloids, so evolution came with unpleasant sensation for such compounds. The typical example is quite bitter caffeine.
- - Is ph paper the same as litmus paper?
  - pH paper and Litmus paper are useful pH indicators. However, pH paper can give the pH value of the solution whereas litmus paper can only determine whether a solution is acidic or basic. This is the main difference between pH paper and litmus paper.
- - What does the pH scale measure to determine the pH value of a solution?
  - The pH is a scale that measures the H+ conc of a solution. With the concentration, the pH can determine how acidic the solution is. Likewise, it can also measure the concentration of OH- to determine how basic it is.
- - What is the definition of pH?
  - The definition of pH is -Log[H+].
- - What is the formula to measure pH?
  - pH = -Log[H+]
- - What is the correlation between H+ concentration and pH value?
  - As the value of H+ concentration increases, the value of the pH of the solution decreases. This will mean that the solution is acidic. Vice-versa when the value of H+ decreases.
- - How do we measure basicity of a solution?
  - To measure basicity, pOH = -Log[OH-]
- - What is the formula to measure pH of a solution that is basic?
  - The formula is pOH = -Log[OH-], where [OH- ] is the concentration of OH- in the solution.
- - Does pOH have units?
  - pOH have no units and it is only a value of representation.
- - What is the correlation between [OH-] and the value of pH of a solution?
  - As the value of OH- concentration increases, the value of pH of the solution decreases. This means that the solution is becoming more basic. Vice-versa for when the concentration of OH- decreases.
- - Are the terms pOH and pH related to one another?
  - The relation between the two terms is pOH + pH = 14
- - How do we calculate pH of weak acids and bases?
  - We can calculate the pH of weak acids and bases by using the ICE table. I stands for initial concentration, C stands for change in concentration( always -x), E stands for equilibrium.
- - What can act as a conjugate base and acid?
  - PO43− can act as only conjugate base as it can only accept a proton but H2PO4− can act as both conjugate acid and conjugate base, as it can accept a proton to form H3PO4 and can donate a proton to form HPO42− and PO42−.
- - What is the strength of a conjugate acid and base pairs?
  - The stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base. The stronger the base, the weaker the conjugate acid.
- - How do we identify for a conjugate base and acid pair in a chemical reaction?
  - In the Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, a conjugate acid–base pair consists of two substances that differ only by the presence of a proton (H⁺). A conjugate acid is formed when a proton is added to a base, and a conjugate base is formed when a proton is removed from an acid.
- - What is the formula relating Kw?
  - Ka x Kb = Kw
- - Why is OH- the strongest base?
  - The oxygen in hydroxide ion is a better proton (H+) acceptor than the oxygen in water because the electron density at the oxygen in hyroxide ion is higher. The oxygen atom in hydroxide is sharing fewer of its electron pairs and is therefore more negative.
- - Why is chlorine/chloride ion the weakest base?
  - A strong acid like HCl donates its proton so readily that there is essentially no tendency for the conjugate base Cl– to reaccept a proton. Consequently, Cl– is a very weak base. A strong base like the H– ion accepts a proton and holds it so firmly that there is no tendency for the conjugate acid H2 to donate a proton.
- - What is the strongest base ion?
  - The strongest base ion is OH- ions.
- - What is the weakest base ion?
  - The weakest base ion is Cl- ions.
- - What are salts?
  - It is a substance produced by the reaction of an acid with a base. A salt consists of the positive ion (cation) of a base and the negative ion (anion) of an acid. The reaction between an acid and a base is called a neutralization reaction.
- - How do I measure the pH of a salt solution?
  - Salts that are from strong bases and weak acids do hydrolyze, which gives it a pH greater than 7. The anion in the salt is derived from a weak acid, most likely organic, and will accept the proton from the water in the reaction. In a weak base-strong acid titration, the acid and base will react to form an acidic solution. A conjugate acid will be produced during the titration, which then reacts with water to form hydronium ions. This results in a solution with a pH lower than 7.
- - What are buffers?
  - solution usually containing an acid and a base, or a salt, that tends to maintain a constant hydrogen ion concentration and resist a change in pH upon addition of small amounts of acid or base.
- - Why are buffers used?
  - A buffer is a solution that can resist pH change upon the addition of an acidic or basic components. It is able to neutralize small amounts of added acid or base, thus maintaining the pH of the solution relatively stable. This is important for processes and/or reactions which require specific and stable pH ranges.
- - Can a buffer have a strong acid?
  - Buffers cannot be made from a strong acid or strong base and its conjugate. This is because they ionize completely. It is important to be able to recognize buffer solutions.
- - When does a buffer lose its effectiveness?
  - Buffers are effective at resisting large changes in pH when the pH is approximately equal to the pKa of the weak acid. However, if the concentration of one component of a buffer is more than 10 times the concentration of the other component in a buffer, buffers are not effective at resisting large changes to pH.
- - What does a buffer contains?
  - A buffer contains a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.
- - How do we identify a buffer solution?
  - A buffer solution is a solution that only changes slightly when an acid or a base is added to it. The process are drop wise and high amount of acid or base added will not work in identifying the buffer.
- - How do buffers work?
  - Buffers work by neutralizing any added acid H+ ions or base OH- ions to maintain the moderate pH, making them a weaker acid or base.
- - What is the meaning of buffering capacity?
  - It is the ability of a buffer to tolerate added acid or base without changing its pH.
- - How to obtain a good buffer?
  - A buffer is more useful when it has equal amounts of acid and base and it will have equally good buffering capacity against added acid or base.
- - What does a buffer functions on?
  - A buffer functions based on the presence of weak base/conjugate base to neutralize added acid or the presence of weak acid/conjugate acid to neutralize added base.
- - What is the purpose of titrations/ acid-base titrations?
  - Titrations are used to determine the total concentration of acid or base in a solution.
- - Is equivalence point the same as equilibrium?
  - The titrant (strong base) has neutralize some of the weak acid and formed it conjugate base.  At the equivalence point, moles of acid equals moles of base.
- - Is the equivalence point always 7?
  - The equivalence point in the titration of a strong acid or a strong base occurs at pH 7.0. In titrations of weak acids or weak bases, however, the pH at the equivalence point is greater or less than 7.0, respectively.
- - Is the equivalence point the same as neutralization?
  - When an acid is neutralized the amount of base added to it must be equal the amount of acid present initially. This amount of base is said to be the equivalent amount. In a titration of an acid with a base, the point of neutralization can also be called the equivalence point.
- - What is the difference between end point and equivalence point of a titration?
  - Equivalence point represents the stage of titration where the concentrations of titrate and titrant are chemically equivalent. An endpoint represents the stage of titration that indicates the completion of the titration with the help of the change in colour or intensity of the solution.
- - What is the difference between halfway point and equivalence point?
  - The equivalence point occurs when the acid has been neutralized. The half-equivalence point is halfway between the equivalence point and the origin. This is the point at which the pH of the solution is equal to the dissociation constant (pKa) of the acid.
- - How can titration be used to determine concentration of acid or base?
  - Titrations are common volumetric procedures where a known concentration and volume of one solution (the titrant) is reacted with a known volume of another solution in order to determine the concentration of an analyte in the unknown solution.
- - What is stoichiometric point?
  - The stoichiometric point in the titration is defined as the point when the moles of titrant is equal to the moles of the solution of unknown concentration.
- - Where is the stoichiometric point?
  - The equivalence point or stoichiometric point is the point in a chemical reaction when there is exactly enough acid and base to neutralize the solution. In a titration, it is where the moles of titrant equal the moles of solution of unknown concentration.
- - What is the second stoichiometric point?
  - The point at which all the acid or base in the analyte (the solution being analyzed) has been neutralized is called the equivalence point; depending on the acid or base in the analyte, some titrations will have a second equivalence point as well.
- - What is the pH at the stoichiometric point?
  - At the stoichiometric or equivalence point (S on the curve), stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of acid and base have reacted and the reaction is complete. At the stoichiometric point, the pH is 7 because water is the only product.
- - How to identify an amphoteric substance?
  - Amphoteric substances can be identified by repeatedly removing hydrogen ions from an acid or by repeatedly adding hydrogen ions to a base. NO−2 is not amphoteric because it is not an acid--it has no more hydrogen ions, let alone more hydrogen ions than can be removed.
- - What does a titration do?
  - titration is the detection of the equivalence point, the point at which chemically equivalent amounts of the reactants have been mixed. The amount of reactants that have been mixed at the equivalence point depends on the stoichiometry of the reaction.
- - How does titration determine concentration?
  - In a titration, a carefully measured volume of a solution of known concentration, called the titrant, is added to a measured volume of a solution containing a compound whose concentration is to be determined.
- - Can titration determine molarity?
  - Titration is used to determine the unknown molarity ( M ) of a solution (called analyte) using a titrant, which is a solution of known concentration.
- - How do you find molarity from titration?
  - Divide the number of moles of analyte present by the original volume of the analyte. For example, if the original volume of the analyte was 500 mL, divide by 1000 mL per L to obtain 0.5 L. Divide 0.01 moles of analyte by 0.5 L to obtain 0.02 moles per liter. This is the concentration or molarity.
- - What is the difference between volumetric analysis and tiration?
  - The key difference between volumetric analysis and titration is that the term volumetric analysis is used where analysis is done to analyse a solution for several different unknown values whereas the term titration is used where the concentration of an unknown component of a solution is determined.

  - Compounds which have the same molecular formula but differ in their arrangement of atoms in space are called isomers and the property is called isomerism. For example, cisplatin. It has two isomeric forms, the cis form and the trans form. The figure below shows cis and trans platin (left- cis platin, right- trans platin). The cis form is used in cancer therapy.
- - According to Werner’s theory, how many types of valencies do metal complexes have?
  - Metal complexes have two types of valencies, a primary valency and a secondary valency. Primary valency corresponds to the oxidation state of the metal ion and secondary valency corresponds to the coordination number of the metal ion.
- - what are ambidentate ligands?
  - Ambidentate ligands are ligands which can bond to the central atom in two places. This is because they have more than one donor atom which can coordinate. It is important to note that these ligands are capable of bonding to a central atom through two different atoms, but only bonds with one of them at a time.
- - What are Arrhenius acids and Bases?
  - The acids which give H+ ions in water are called Arrhenius acids. The bases which give OH– ions in water are called Arrhenius bases. For example, CO2 is an Arrhenius acid and CaO is an Arrhenius base.
- - What are ligands?
  - an ion or molecule attached to a metal atom by coordinate bonding.
- - What are metal complexes?
  - A metal complex consists of a central metal atom or ion that is bonded to one or more ligands, which are ions or molecules that contain one or more pairs of electrons that can be shared with the metal. Metal complexes can be neutral, positively charged, or negatively charged.
- - What metals form complexes?
  - Although coordination complexes are particularly important in the chemistry of the transition metals, some main group elements also form complexes. Aluminum, tin, and lead, for example, form complexes such as the AlF63-, SnCl42- and PbI42- ions.
- - How complexes are formed?
  - A complex is made up of a central metal atom/ion surrounded by negatively charged ions or neutral molecules possessing a lone pair of electrons (ligands). A complex may be charged or uncharged, if it is charged it is called a complex ion, for example [Fe(H2O)6]3+.
- - Is viscosity important in chemical reaction?
  - Viscosity can be not only a fluid's resistance to flow but also a gas' resistance to flow, change shape or movement. The opposite of viscosity is fluidity which measures the ease of flow while liquids such as motor oil or honey which are “sluggish” and high in viscosity are known as viscous.
- - How does viscosity affect reaction rate?
  - Solvent viscosity is also important in determining reaction rates. In highly viscous solvents, dissolved particles diffuse much more slowly than in less viscous solvents and can collide less frequently per unit time. Thus the reaction rates of most reactions decrease rapidly with increasing solvent viscosity.
- - What factors affect the rate of chemical reactions?
  - Reactant concentration. Increasing the concentration of one or more reactants will often increase the rate of reaction. Physical state of the reactants and surface area. Temperature.Presence of a catalyst.
- - Is viscosity a chemical property?
  - It's a physical property as viscosity is the measure of how fast or slow a liquid flows. It's dependent on the liquid intermolecular forces and the adhesive forces.
- - Which condition will increase the rate of a chemical reaction?
  - Rate of reaction increases as concentration and temperature increases. High concentration leads to more collision probability and higher temperature provides more kinetic energy for effective collisions.
- - What are 3 things that must happen in order for a chemical reaction to occur?
  - Molecules must collide. Molecules must collide with enough energy to begin to break the old bonds so new bonds can form (activation energy). Molecules must collide with the correct orientation.
- - What is required for chemical reactions?
  - requirement for a reaction to occur is that the reactant particles (atoms or molecules) must collide and interact with each other in some way. This is the central idea of the collision model, which is used to explain many of the observations made about chemical kinetics.
- - What is kinetics?
  - Chemical kinetics is the description of the rate of a chemical reaction. This is the rate at which the reactants are transformed into products. This may take place by abiotic or by biological systems, such as microbial metabolism.
- - What must be true for a chemical reaction to occur?
  - According to the collision theory, the following criteria must be met in order for a chemical reaction to occur, Molecules must collide with sufficient energy, known as the activation energy, so that chemical bonds can break. Molecules must collide with the proper orientation.

  - One of the factors which do not affect the rate of the reaction is temperature. One of the factors which do not affect the rate of the reaction is temperature.
- - What would cause the rate of a chemical reaction to slow?
  - Reducing the concentration decreases the frequency of collisions between reactants. A smaller number of collisions means reduced contact and slower reaction rate.
- - Why do higher concentrations have faster reactions?
  - If the concentration of reactants is increased, there are more reactant particles moving together. There will be more collisions and so the reaction rate is increased. The higher the concentration of reactants, the faster the rate of a reaction will be.
- - How does a greater concentration affect the rate of reaction?
  - Increasing the concentration of reactants generally increases the rate of reaction because more of the reacting molecules or ions are present to form the reaction products. This is especially true when concentrations are low and few molecules or ions are reacting.

  - A weak ligand or a weak field ligand is a ligand which can result in lower crystal field theory. The complexes formed with these ligands are also known as high spin complexes. They are mostly paramagnetic in nature. A strong ligand or a strong field ligand is any ligand which has high crystal field theory.
- - Why is ammonia a stronger ligand than water?
  - H2O is weaker ligand as compared to NH3 as the donor atom is Oxygen which is more electronegative than Nitrogen. So as the electronegativity of central atom decrease, the ligand becomes stronger.
- - What is chelate effect?
  - The chelate effect is the greater affinity of chelating ligands for a metal ion than that of similar nonchelating (monodentate) ligands for the same metal.

  - Ligand strength affects how the electrons fill these orbitals. When surrounded by weak-field ligands, electrons fill the orbitals as normal, one electron fills each orbital before a second joins in. These complexes have high spin.
- - Why are some ligands neutral?
  - Coordination compounds are composed of two parts a metal and a ligand. The major role played by a ligand is the donation of electrons to the metal part in a complex. Neutral ligands are those ligands that do not have any charge over them.

- - What is the difference between end point and equivalence point?
  - The main difference between equivalence and endpoint is that the equivalence point is a point where the chemical reaction comes to an end while the endpoint is the point where the colour change occurs in a system.
- - What is the difference between the indicator endpoint for a titration and the equivalence point of the titration?
  - The endpoint is simply the end of the titration reaction indicated by the change in color of the selected indicator. Whereas the equivalence point is a point at which exactly enough amount of titrant neutralizes the analyte.
- - What is potentiometric acid base titration?
  - Potentiometric titration is a laboratory method to determine the concentration of a given analyte. It is used in the characterization of acids. In this method, there is no use of a chemical indicator. Instead, the electric potential across the substance is measured.
- - Why is it important to repeat the experiment many times?
  - Repeating an experiment more than once helps determine if the data was a fluke, or represents the normal case. It helps guard against jumping to conclusions without enough evidence. The number of repeats depends on many factors, including the spread of the data and the availability of resources.
- - Why is potentiometric titration more accurate?
  - It requires a small quantity of substances. There is no need to use indicators for potentiometric titration. The titrations results are accurate as no colour indicators are involved.
- - Why non aqueous titration is done?
  - The need for non-aqueous titration arises because water can behave as a weak base and a weak acid as well, and can hence compete in proton acceptance or proton donation with other weak acids and bases dissolved in it.
- - Why is repeating an experiment important?
  - To repeat an experiment, under the same conditions, allows you to estimate the variability of the results (how close to each other they are) and to increase the accuracy of the estimate (assuming that no bias – systematic error – is present).
- - How does repetition increase reliability?
  - Repetition will only determine reliability it will not improve it. Reliability can be improved by carefully controlling all variables.

  - The formula used is pH = -Log[H+], where [H+] is the concentration of the analyte.
- - How do I find the conjugate acid-base pair?
  - In the Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases, a conjugate acid–base pair consists of two substances that differ only by the presence of a proton (H⁺). A conjugate acid is formed when a proton is added to a base, and a conjugate base is formed when a proton is removed from an acid.
- - What do I have to ensure when making a buffer solution?
  - A buffer must contain a weak acid and its conjugate base. There are several ways a solution containing these two components can be made, Buffers can be made from weak acids or base and their salts.
- - How do I predict if a salt solution is basic, neutral, or acidic?
  - When a strong base and strong acid is reacted together, they form a neutral salt solution. When a strong acid reacted with a weak base, they form an acidic salt solution as the weak base could not counteract the strong acid. When a strong base is reacted with a weak acid, it forms a basic salt solution. When a weak acid and a weak base are mixed, they come to an equilibrium state represented by the following equation, HA(aq) + B(aq) ⇌ A⁻(aq) + HB⁺(aq).
- - Is acetic acid a weak acid?
  - Acetic acid (found in vinegar) is a very common weak acid. Its ionization is shown below. The ionization of acetic acid is incomplete, and so the equation is shown with a double arrow. The extent of ionization of weak acids varies, but is generally less than 10%.

- - What is the arhenius theory?
  - Arrhenius theory, theory, introduced in 1887 by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, that acids are substances that dissociate in water to yield electrically charged atoms or molecules, called ions, one of which is a hydrogen ion (H+), and that bases ionize in water to yield hydroxide ions (OH−).
- - How acids and bases dissociate?
  - Strong acids and strong bases refer to species that completely dissociate to form ions in solution. By contrast, weak acids and bases ionize only partially, and the ionization reaction is reversible. Thus, weak acid and base solutions contain multiple charged and uncharged species in dynamic equilibrium.
- - what is the pH of a strong acid?
  - Strong acids like hydrochloric acid at the sort of concentrations you normally use in the lab have a pH around 0 to 1. The lower the pH, the higher the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution.

  - Hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Formed from the activation of phagocytes through myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated peroxidation of Cl−using H2O2. Although a weak acid (pKa=7.5), HOCl is considered a strong oxidizing agent responsible for the killing action of phagocytes against a variety of pathogens.
- - How do I calculate the hydroxide ion concentration of a solution?
  - Using the formula pH = -Log[H+]. Rearrange it to -pH = Log[H+] by multiplying -1 on both sides. Formulating y = logb x, to x = b^y. Hence, [H+] = 10^-pH. From there substitute the value in to find the concentration of [H+]. [H+][OH-] = 1 x 10^-14. [OH-] = 1 x 10^-14 / [H+].

  - ka and kb are inversely propotional . Acidic and basic strength is inversely proportional to ka and kb respectively bescause measure of its strength is negative of log(ka or kb).
- - What is the difference between KA and KB?
  - The lower Ka for the acid indicates that it's a weak acid that holds tightly onto the donatable proton. The weaker the acid, the stronger the base. The stronger the base, the higher the Kb. The weaker the acid, the lower the Ka.
- - What is the KW value?
  - Like any other equilibrium constant, the value of Kw varies with temperature. Its value is usually taken to be 1.00 x 10-14 mol2 dm-6 at room temperature. In fact, this is its value at a bit less than 25°C.
- - What is the difference between KA and pKa?
  - Ka is acid dissociation constant and represents the strength of the acid. pKa is the -log of Ka, having a smaller comparable values for analysis. They have an inverse relationship. Larger the Ka, smaller the pKa and stronger the acid.
- - Can kb be negative?
  - pKb is the negative logarithm of Kb.
- - Can Ka be negative?
  - As Kc and Ka are the ratios of product concentration divided by the reactant concentration, neither of those values can be negative. Therefore,the value of Kc and Ka value cannot be negative.
- - Why is kw constant?
  - Given that Kw equals to [H+][OH-], doesn't concentration of these 2 differ in acids, water and alkali? Why is Kw only affected by temperature? Concentrations differ, of course, but their product does not. That's why it is called a constant.
- - What affects the Kw constant?
  - Like any other equilibrium constant, Kw varies with temperature, ranging from 1.15×10−15 at 0 °C to 4.99×10−13 at 100 °C.
- - What affects the Ka?
  - The ONLY factor that affect Ka is temperature, and therefore there is no influence of concentration change on the value of Ka.
- - Does KB change with concentration?
  - Ka is the equilibrium constant of the dissociation of an acid. The concentrations in the expression of Ka are the equilibrium concentration, they change however, their ratio remains constant, and therefore, the name of constant Ka.
- - Does K value increase with concentration?
  - If you decrease the concentration of C, the top of the Kc expression gets smaller. That would change the value of Kc. In order for that not to happen, the concentrations of C and D will have to increase again, and those of A and B must decrease.
- - Why does equilibrium constant not change with concentration?
  - Equilibrium constants are not changed if you change the concentrations of things present in the equilibrium. The only thing that changes an equilibrium constant is a change of temperature. The position of equilibrium is changed if you change the concentration of something present in the mixture.

  - the law of mass action dictates that the equilibrium constant, at a given constant temperature, is equal to the product of the concentration of products raised to the respective stoichiometric coefficients divided by the product of the reactant concentrations, each raised to the corresponding stoichiometric.
- - What are some examples of the law of mass action?
  - For example, if the temperature in a system containing a mixture of ice and water is uniformly 273.15 K, the net amount of ice formed and melted will be zero. The amount of liquid water will also remain constant, if no vapor escapes from the system.
- - How does the concentration of reactants affect direction of chemical equilibrium?
  - If the concentration of a reactant is increased the equilibrium will shift in the direction of the reaction that uses the reactants, so that the reactant concentration decreases.
- - What is the effect of a change in concentration of a reactant or product on a chemical reaction initially at equilibrium?
  - If a chemical reaction is at equilibrium and experiences a change in pressure, temperature, or concentration of products or reactants, the equilibrium shifts in the opposite direction to offset the change.
- - Why does concentration and pressure not affect KC?
  - The equilibrium constant, Kc is the ratio of the rate constants, so only variables that affect the rate constants can affect Kc. Pressure doesn't show in any of these relationships. It may also be useful to think about different ways pressure can be changed. The volume of the reaction can be changed.
- - Why is K not dependent on concentration?
  - If you mean the rate constant k , then no, it does not depend on concentrations at any time in the reaction. When we say it is constant, we mean it is constant with respect to concentration, it is not a function of concentration.
- - What does KC depend on?
  - Kc depends on the rate constants which in turn depend on the reaction (Ea) and temperature. No units on Kc. Pure solids and pure liquids are excluded from Kc. A catalyst does not change the equilibrium concentrations, so it does not change Kc.
- - Can catalyst be reused?
  - No. The possibilities for how a catalysts actually works are endless. Some catalysts actually change during the course of the chemical reaction, but then are returned to their original state at the end of the reaction.
- - How does a catalyst not get used up?
  - A catalyst is a substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate without getting consumed in the process. Catalysts typically speed up a reaction by reducing the activation energy or changing the reaction mechanism.
- - How does catalyst change the reaction mechanism?
  - Changing the mechanism will change the activation energy of the slow step. Changing the activation energy will change the rate constant (rate constant is a function of activation energy).
- - What happens if you add too much catalyst?
  - Catalysts speed up chemical reactions. Only very minute quantities of the catalyst are required to produce a dramatic change in the rate of the reaction. This is really because the reaction proceeds by a different pathway when the catalyst is present. Adding extra catalyst will make no difference.
- - Are catalysts regenerated in reactions?
  - In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst generally enters into chemical combination with the reactants but is ultimately regenerated, so the amount of catalyst remains unchanged. Since the catalyst is not consumed, each catalyst molecule may induce the transformation of many molecules of reactants.
- - What makes a good catalyst?
  - A good catalyst needs to adsorb the reactant molecules strongly enough for them to react, but not so strongly that the product molecules stick more or less permanently to the surface. Silver, for example, isn't a good catalyst because it doesn't form strong enough attachments with reactant molecules.

  - Le Chatelier's principle says, if a stress is applied to a reaction mixture at equilibrium, the net reaction goes in the direction that relieves the stress. Change in the concentration of a reactant or product is one way to place a stress on a reaction at equilibrium.
- - How does concentration affect the solution?
  - When additional water is added to an aqueous solution, the concentration of that solution decreases. This is because the number of moles of the solute does not change, but the total volume of the solution increases.
- - Which will not change the rate of a reaction?
  - If you have a reaction order of Zero, this basically means that the concentration of the reactants does not affect the rate of reaction.
- - Why do concentrations remain constant at equilibrium?
  - Since the forward and reverse rates are equal, the concentrations of the reactants and products are constant at equilibrium.
- - Is equilibrium constant independent of initial concentration?
  - For a given set of reaction conditions, the equilibrium constant is independent of the initial analytical concentrations of the reactant and product species in the mixture.
- - How does temperature affect concentration?
  - If the temperature is raised, the kinetic energies of both A and B are increased so that there are more collisions per second, and a greater fraction of these will lead to chemical reaction.
- - What is lifetime of a catalyst?
  - Catalyst lifetime is highly dependent on reaction conditions, including the operating temperature and pressure, reactor configuration, impurity profile of the feed, and so on.
- - What changes will increase the rate of reaction?
  - A higher concentration of reactants leads to more effective collisions per unit time and leads to an increasing reaction rate. Changing the pressure of gaseous reactants is, in effect, changing their concentration. The increased number of collisions caused by a higher pressure increases the reaction rate.
- - Which factors will slow down the rate of chemical reaction?
  - Factors that can affect rates of reactions include surface area, temperature, concentration, and the presence of catalysts and inhibitors. Temperature - Changing the temperature of a chemical reaction also affects the reaction rate.
- - Does solubility increases with an increase of temperature?
  - The solubility (concentration) increases with an increase in temperature. If the process is exothermic (heat given off). A temperature rise will decrease the solubility by shifting the equilibrium to the left.
- - How do the concentrations of reactants and products change over time at equilibrium?
  - The concentrations of the reactants and products do not change with time. This does not mean that the concentrations of the reactants and products are equal but that their concentrations are unchanging because the forward and reverse reactions are occurring at equal rates.
- - How does concentration affect the activation energy?
  - If temperature or reactant concentration is increased, the rate of a given reaction generally increases as well.
- - What does the law of mass action affects?
  - Law of mass action, law stating that the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the masses of the reacting substances, with each mass raised to a power equal to the coefficient that occurs in the chemical equation.

  - A catalyst is a substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate without getting consumed in the process. Catalysts typically speed up a reaction by reducing the activation energy or changing the reaction mechanism. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions.
- - How does a heterogeneous catalyst work?
  - Heterogeneous catalysts are catalysts which exist in a different phase to the reactants. For example, a solid catalyst used in a reaction with liquids would be a heterogeneous catalyst – you can remember this by knowing that 'hetero' means 'different'. Heterogenous catalysts work mainly through the same mechanism.
- - how does a homogeneous catalyst work?
  - These catalysts can be homogeneous, which means a catalyst that's in the same phase, or heterogeneous, which means a catalyst in different phases. A homogeneous catalyst mixes the catalyst with the reactants, allowing it to speed up the reaction.
- - How does an autocatalyst work?
  - In an autocatalytic reaction, the products of the reaction amplify the rate of their production. These products are called autocatalysts.
- - What factors increase solubility?
  - Temperature, solubility increases with temperature, Polarity. In most cases solutes dissolve in solvents that have a similar polarity. Pressure, Molecular size, and stirring increases the speed of dissolving.
- - What is a catalyst made of?
  - The catalyst component of a catalytic converter is usually platinum (Pt), along with palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh). All three of these platinum group metals, or PGMs, are extremely rare but have a broad range of applications in addition to catalytic converters.
- - What is meant by catalyst and Catalysis?
  - Catalysis is defined as increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by introducing a catalyst. A catalyst, in turn, is a substance that is not consumed by the chemical reaction, but acts to lower its activation energy. In other words, a catalyst is both a reactant and product of a chemical reaction.
- - How does a catalyst reduce activation energy?
  - A catalyst lowers the activation energy by changing the transition state of the reaction. The reaction then goes through a different pathway/mechanism than the uncatalyzed reaction. The catalyst does not change the net energy difference between reactant and product.
- - how does an acid base catalysis work?
  - General acid-base catalysis involves a molecule besides water that acts as a proton donor or acceptor during the enzymatic reaction. Acid-base catalysis facilitates a reaction by stabilizing the charges in the transition state through the use of an acid or base, which donates protons or accepts them, respectively.
- - Does increasing the concentration of a substance increase the kinetic energy of the particles that make up the substance?
  - Increasing the (concentration, temperature) of a substance increases the kinetic energy of the particles that make up the particles. If a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system shifts in the direction that relieves the stress. The effect of increasing the concentration is the same as increasing temperature.
- - How does an acid catalyst work?
  - In acid-catalyzed Fischer esterification, the proton binds to oxygens and functions as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl (top row) as an electrophile, and converts the hydroxyl into the good leaving group water (bottom left). Both lower the kinetic barrier and speed up the attainment of chemical equilibrium.

  - Hydrochloric acid is considered as a promising catalyst to catalyze the esterification of FFAs and methanol for biodiesel production, as indicated by the experimental results.
- - What are the features of homogeneous catalyst?
  - Homogeneous catalysts, usually organometallic complexes, have a recognized high efficiency both in terms of activity and selectivity and they are active under mild reaction conditions. They fail, however, in the ease of removing the catalyst from products.
- - What are the advantages and disadvantages of these homogeneous catalysts?
  - An advantage of homogeneous catalysis is there is a very high degree of interaction between the catalyst and reactant molecules due to both being in the same phase (as opposed to heterogeneous catalysis). A disadvantage is the homogeneous catalyst is often irrecoverable after the reaction has run to completion.

  - The advantage of using acidic catalysts is insensitive to FFA content in the oil and thus elimination of side reaction such as saponification. Furthermore, acidic catalysts are able to perform esterification and transesterification simultaneously.
- - What is the principle of acid-base titration?
  - The strength of an acid solution is determined by titrating it against a standard base solution or determining the strength of an alkali solution by titration with a standard acid solution referred to as Acid-Base Titration.
- - What are the four types of acid-base titration?
  - The first is titration of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide.

- - What is catalyst and its function?
  - A catalyst is a substance that affects, promotes or accelerates reaction of two or more substances to generate a different end product.
- - How does a catalyst work chemistry?
  - During a chemical reaction, the bonds between the atoms in molecules are broken, rearranged, and rebuilt, recombining the atoms into new molecules. Catalysts make this process more efficient by lowering the activation energy, which is the energy barrier that must be surmounted for a chemical reaction to occur.
- - How do i recover a catalyst?
  - Washing with low concentrated solution of sodium bicarbonate is good solution, if there is not a salt formulation of your main product during the process. One of the way to recover a homogeneous catalyst is an extraction of product by organic solvent with low boiling temperature.
- - Can a catalyst be recovered unchanged?
  - A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of reaction, but can be recovered, unchanged at the end. Only a very small mass of catalyst is needed to increase the rate of a reaction.
- - Why is salt solution a mixture?
  - One cannot be able to determine its composition just by taking a look at the solution. In your case, in order for sodium chloride solution to be a mixture, it must contain sodium chloride (salt) and another substance, mixed together such that it appears as if it were only composed of one substance.
- - Why is a salt solution a homogeneous mixture?
  - A homogeneous mixture is a mixture in which the composition is uniform throughout the mixture. The homogeneous solution has dissolved salt is evenly distributed throughout the entire salt water sample.
- - Is salt a heterogeneous mixture?
  - Salt solution is a homogeneous mixture.
- - How do you describe a salt solution?
  - Saline solution (or saline) refers to any sodium chloride solutions of different concentrations. The most widely saline solution is 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. It is also known as normal saline solution or physiological saline. Saline is homogenous; the particles are distributed uniformly in the solution.
- - Does a catalyst disappear?
  - In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst generally enters into chemical combination with the reactants but is ultimately regenerated, so the amount of catalyst remains unchanged. Since the catalyst is not consumed, each catalyst molecule may induce the transformation of many molecules of reactants.
- - Can a catalyst decrease the rate of reaction?
  - A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction, without being consumed by the reaction. It increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy for a reaction.
- - What makes something a ligand?
  - Ligands are ions or neutral molecules that bond to a central metal atom or ion. Ligands act as Lewis bases (electron pair donors), and the central atom acts as a Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor). Ligands have at least one donor atom with an electron pair used to form covalent bonds with the central atom.
- - What are types of ligands?
  - The ligands can be classified into three types, simple, complex, and coordinative unsaturation. A simple ligand is an atom or molecule that binds directly to the metal ion. The most common simple ligands are oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, carbon monoxide and water.
- - Is chlorine a ligand?
  - Chloride is commonly found as both a terminal ligand and a bridging ligand.
- - Is CH4 a ligand?
  - No. Ligands are, by definition, electron pair donors and so require at least one lone pair of electrons that can be donated to a metal ion to form a covalent bond. Methane, CH4, has no lone pairs. Fe(II) generally forms octahedral complexes.
- - What kind of ligand is NH3?
  - Ammonia (NH3) is known to be a strong field ligand since the donor atom in this case is nitrogen.
- - Which molecule or ion does not act as a ligand?
  - Methane CH4 cannot act as a ligand in complex compounds as all electrons in it are paired. There is no lone pair of electrons or pi electrons which can be donated to metal to form a bond.
- - What is meant by coordination complex?
  - a compound or ion with a central usually metallic atom or ion combined by coordinate bonds with a definite number of surrounding ions, groups, or molecules. Also called coordination compound.
- - Which are strong ligands?
  - Those ligands which cause larger splitting of d orbitals and favour pairing of electrons are called strong field ligands. Strong field ligands contain C, N, and P as donor atoms. e.g. CN– , NCS– , CO, NH3, EDTA, en (ethylenediammine).
- - Is H2O a strong ligand?
  - Water is a weak field ligand. The electronegative O atom is strongly electron-withdrawing, so there is poor orbital overlap between the electron pair on O and a metal d-orbital.
- - How do you identify a weak field ligand?
  - It depends on the central atom, cordination number, oxidation state. If cordination number is 6 (octahedral) and having +2 oxidation state then it is weak ligand and in +3 oxidation state it is strong ligand. If cordination number is 4 (tetrahedral) then it is weak ligand.
- - Do catalysts last forever?
  - If catalysts truly remain unchanged, they should last forever, but in actual practice, various events can occur that limit the useful lifetime of many catalysts.
- - How do you activate a catalyst?
  - Homogeneously catalysed reactions can be 'switched on' by activating latent catalysts. Usually, activation is brought about by heat or an external chemical agent. However, activation of homogeneous catalysts with a mechanical trigger has not been demonstrated.
- - What's an electrolyte in chemistry?
  - A substance that breaks up into ions (particles with electrical charges) when it is dissolved in water or body fluids. Some examples of ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, and phosphate.
- - Can you make a buffer with a base?
  - Buffers can also be made from weak bases and their conjugate acids.
- - Does precipitate dissolve in water?
  - Precipitates are insoluble ionic solid products of a reaction, formed when certain cations and anions combine in an aqueous solution.
- - What is the difference between solubility and precipitation?
  - If the rules state that an ion is soluble, then it remains in its aqueous ion form. If an ion is insoluble based on the solubility rules, then it forms a solid with an ion from the other reactant. If all the ions in a reaction are shown to be soluble, then no precipitation reaction occurs.
- - Do soluble compounds form precipitates?
  - Any box that reads "soluble" results in an aqueous product in which no precipitate has formed, while "slightly soluble" and "insoluble" markings mean that there is a precipitate that will form.
- - How do you remove a precipitate from a solution?
  - A dissolved compound can be precipitated out of solution by introducing a counter ion. For example, silver can be precipitated out of solution in the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride. The nitrate ion is replaced by a counter-ion, chloride, resulting in the formation of solid silver chloride.
- - Do insoluble compounds form precipitates?
  - The compound is insoluble and will form a precipitate. The products of the reaction must be examined; if either of the substances formed in the reaction is insoluble, a precipitate will form.
- - how do ions form?
  - Ions are formed by the addition of electrons to, or the removal of electrons from, neutral atoms or molecules or other ions; by combination of ions with other particles; or by rupture of a covalent bond between two atoms in such a way that both of the electrons of the bond are left in association with one of the formerly bonded atoms.
- - How do ions conduct electricity?
  - Ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten (liquid) or in aqueous solution (dissolved in water), because their ions are free to move from place to place. Ionic compounds cannot conduct electricity when solid, as their ions are held in fixed positions and cannot move.
- - How does electricity flow through ions?
  - Electric Current is the flow of electrons through a wire or solution. In a solid the electrons are passed from one positively charged metallic atom to next but in solution the electron is carried by the ions present in the solution. A solution capable of carrying charge is called an electrolyte.
- - How do ions carry charge?
  - All ions are charged. So positively charged ions move towards the negative electrode and anions move towards the positively charged electrode. As ions are moving, the charge is moving. This movement of charge produces current.
- - How do ions affect conductivity?
  - Higher concentrations of ions in water increase its ability to conduct electricity and thus its conductivity. Distilled water, on the other hand, has a very low concentration of ions and a low conductivity.
- - Are smaller ions more conductive?
  - In general, smaller ions have greater conductivity than larger ions.
- - How do ions increase conductivity?
  - Electrical currents are transported by ions in a given solution. As the concentration of ions increases, the conductivity increases. This is because conductivity increases as water dissolves more ionic compounds due to the ions transporting an electrical current in the solution.
- - What do dilution factors mean?
  - Dilution Factor is the factor by which the stock solution is diluted. It may be expressed as the ratio of the volume of the final diluted solution to the initial volume removed from the stock solution.
- - Why do we use dilution factor?
  - By performing a dilution on a sample it may reduce the interfering substance to a point where it no longer interferes with the test. When performing a dilution there is a equation that can be used to determine the final concentration.
- - How does dilution factor affect concentration?
  - The dilution factor is the inverse of the concentration factor. For example, if you take 1 part of a sample and add 9 parts of water (solvent), then you have made a 1,10 dilution; this has a concentration of 1/10th (0.1) of the original and a dilution factor of 10.
- - What does the term CFU mean?
  - A CFU is defined as a single, viable propagule that produces a single colony (a population of the cells visible to the naked eye) on an appropriate semisolid growth medium.
- - Is NaCl a polar compound?
  - Sodium Chloride (NaCl) which is an ionic compound acts as a polar molecule. Usually, the large difference in electronegativities in sodium and chlorine makes their bond polar. Besides, in sodium chloride, Na has a +1 charge and Cl has a -1 charge and the bond is a strong one.
- - Is chlorine non polar?
  - An example of a non-polar bond is the bond in chlorine. Chlorine contains two chlorine atoms. The electrons are shared equally because the electronegativity difference between the two atoms is zero.
- - Is NCl3 polar?
  - NCl3 is a slightly polar molecule because of the small difference between the electronegativity of nitrogen and chlorine atom. NCl3 molecule has one lone pair that leads to repulsion between electrons and the shape of the molecule is trional pyramidal.
- - What does polar means?
  - When things are different at each end, we call them polar. Some molecules have positive and negative ends too, and when they do, we call them polar. If they don't, we call them non-polar. Things that are polar can attract and repel each other (opposite charges attract, alike charges repel).
- - Why is water polar?
  - The unequal sharing of electrons between the atoms and the unsymmetrical shape of the molecule means that a water molecule has two poles - a positive charge on the hydrogen pole (side) and a negative charge on the oxygen pole (side). We say that the water molecule is electrically polar.
- - Is oxygen polar or nonpolar?
  - Oxygen is nonpolar. The molecule is symmetric. The two oxygen atoms pull on the electrons by exactly the same amount.
- - Is h2o polar?
  - Water (H2O) is polar because of the bent shape of the molecule. The shape means most of the negative charge from the oxygen on side of the molecule and the positive charge of the hydrogen atoms is on the other side of the molecule. This is an example of polar covalent chemical bonding.
- - How to identify polar and nonpolar molecules?
  - If the arrangement is symmetrical and the arrows are of equal length, the molecule is nonpolar. If the arrows are of different lengths, and if they do not balance each other, the molecule is polar. If the arrangement is asymmetrical, the molecule is polar.
- - What factors are used to determine whether a bond will be polar or nonpolar?
  - The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent.
- - Is CH4 polar or nonpolar?
  - CH4 is non polar.
- - Is pressure affected by temperature?
  - Faster moving particles will collide with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. This causes the force on the walls of the container to increase and so the pressure increases. If the temperature of the gas is measured on the Kelvin scale , the pressure is proportional to the temperature.
- - How does pressure change with temperature?
  - As the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy increases as does the velocity of the gas particles hitting the walls of the container. The force exerted by the particles per unit of area on the container is the pressure, so as the temperature increases the pressure must also increase.
- - Does decreasing temperature increase pressure?
  - If you heat a gas you give the molecules more energy so they move faster. This means more impacts on the walls of the container and an increase in the pressure. Conversely if you cool the molecules down they will slow and the pressure will be decreased.
- - What units are used for pressure?
  - The SI unit for pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to one newton per square metre (N/m2, or kg·m−1·s−2). Pascal is a so-called coherent derived unit in the SI with a special name and symbol.
- - Does solute change boiling point?
  - The boiling point of the solvent above a solution changes as the concentration of the solute in the solution changes (but it does not depend on the identity of either the solvent or the solute(s) particles (kind, size or charge) in the solution).
- - What is the role of solute in boiling point?
  - When a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent, the resulting solution has a higher boiling point than that of the pure solvent. For example, the boiling point of a solution of sodium chloride (salt) and water is greater than that of pure water.
- - What is the difference between solution solvent and solute?
  - A solution is a homogeneous mixture consisting of a solute dissolved into a solvent. The solute is the substance that is being dissolved, while the solvent is the dissolving medium. Solutions can be formed with many different types and forms of solutes and solvents. We know of many types of solutions.
- - What are liquid solutions?
  - A liquid solution is a liquid in which a substance has been completely dissolved. The substance can be either solid, gas, or other liquid . It is different from a liquid suspension in that the molecules of the substance in suspension are not surrounded by solvent molecules.
- - What is a solid solution?
  - A solid solution describes a family of materials which have a range of compositions and a single crystal structure.
- - What is gas solution?
  - A gas solution can be a gas dissolved in a gas, or a liquid dissolved in a gas, or a solid dissolved in a gas. The one thing that they all have in common is that they end up in the gaseous phase. The air that we breathe would be an example of a gas solution.
- - Can a solution be a gas?
  - Solutions can also be gases dissolved in liquids, such as carbonated water. There can also be gases in other gases and liquids in liquids. If you mix things up and they stay at an even distribution, it is a solution.
- - How does equilibrium shift when pressure is increased?
  - According to Le Chatelier's principle, if pressure is increased, then the equilibrium shifts to the side with the fewer number of moles of gas. This particular reaction shows a total of 4 mol of gas as reactants and 2 mol of gas as products, so the reaction shifts toward the products side.
- - Why does equilibrium shift to the right when pressure is increased?
  - According to Le Chatelier's Principle, when there is an increase in pressure then the equilibrium will shift towards the side of the reaction which contains fewer moles of gas and when there is decrease in pressure, the reaction favors the side with more number of moles.
- - What causes the equilibrium to shift to the right?
  - Increasing the temperature causes the equilibrium to shift to the right toward a higher concentration of vapor, but, if the system is maintained at that higher temperature, equilibrium will again be established. It is possible to predict how a particular stress or change in conditions will affect an equilibrium.
- - Why does pressure not affect equilibrium constant?
  - If there are the same number of molecules on each side of the equation, then a change of pressure makes no difference to the position of equilibrium.
- - Why does the equilibrium shift to the left?
  - According to Le Chatelier's principle, adding additional products to the system will shift the equilibrium to the left, so that more reactants are produced. Similarly, equilibrium can be shifted to the left by removing reactants from the system.
- - How do you know if equilibrium shifts left or right?
  - if we add reactant, equilibrium goes right, away from the reactant. If we add product, equilibrium goes left, away from the product. If we remove product, equilibrium goes right, making product. If we remove reactant, equilibrium goes left, making reactant.
- - What will happen to the concentration of reactants after an equilibrium reaction shifts to the left?
  - Le Chatelier's principle predicts that the equilibrium will shift to increase the concentration of reactants. Increasing the rate of the reverse reaction will mean an increase in reactants. So some sulfur trioxide would change back to sulfur dioxide and oxygen to restore equilibrium. Equilibrium shifts to the left.
- - Why does a system at equilibrium shift when it is subjected to some change?
  - A chemical system at equilibrium can be temporarily shifted out of equilibrium by adding or removing one or more of the reactants or products. The concentrations of both reactants and products then undergo additional changes to return the system to equilibrium.
- - Does an increase in pressure Favour the forward reaction?
  - An increase in pressure on an equilibrium system favours the reaction which products fewer total moles of gas.
- - Which way does equilibrium shift when volume is increased?
  - When there is an increase in volume, the equilibrium will shift to favor the direction that produces more moles of gas.
- - How does a change in pressure affect a gas phase equilibrium reaction?
  - Le Chatelier's principle implies that a pressure increase shifts an equilibrium to the side of the reaction with the fewer number of moles of gas, while a pressure decrease shifts an equilibrium to the side of the reaction with the greater number of moles of gas.
- - Which way does equilibrium shift when concentration is increased?
  - If the concentration of a reactant is increased the equilibrium will shift in the direction of the reaction that uses the reactants, so that the reactant concentration decreases. The forward reaction is favoured.
- - Does changing concentration affect equilibrium constant?
  - Equilibrium constants are not changed if you change the concentrations of things present in the equilibrium. The only thing that changes an equilibrium constant is a change of temperature. The position of equilibrium is changed if you change the concentration of something present in the mixture.
- - What does it mean for equilibrium to shift?
  - Simply shifting equilibrium means increased rate of conversion of substances, predicating on the change in the reaction in the first place.
- - Does the position of equilibrium depend on the starting concentrations?
  - he position of equilibrium for a given reaction does not depend on the starting concentrations and so the value of the equilibrium constant is truly constant. It does, however, depend on the temperature of the reaction.
- - Why does concentration affect KC?
  - This is because if you increase the temp., you drive the equilibrium backwards (in the endothermic direction), and therefore increase the concentration of reactants and decrease the concentration of products. If endothermic, increasing the temperature will increase Kc, and vice-verca.
- - Does concentration affect rate constant?
  - The change in rate constant depends on the type of reaction, and which reactant's concentrations change. If the concentrations of the reactants increase, the rate constant increases. The rate constant is directly proportional to the concentration of any given reactant.
- - Which factors affect equilibrium constant?
  - The equilibrium constant is influenced by temperature changes, and the rate of reaction is also affected by temperature changes. The equilibrium constant of an exothermic reaction decreases as temperature rises. The equilibrium constant in an endothermic reaction increases as the temperature rises.
- - What variables affect K and in what direction?
  - Temperature is the only factor that we learned affects K value. The direction of change in K value depends if the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. If the temperature increases, K will increase in an endothermic reaction and decrease in an exothermic reaction.
- - What are the four factors that can shift the position of an equilibrium?
  - The temperature, pressure, and concentration of the system are all factors that affect equilibrium. When one of these factors changes, the equilibrium of the system is disrupted, and the system readjusts itself until it returns to equilibrium.
- - How does concentration affect the equilibrium position of a reversible reaction?
  - Adding a chemical that is present on either side of the equation will cause a shift in the position of the equilibrium, as the system adjusts to counteract the change.
- - What is the Lewis structure rule?
  - The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called lone pairs) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms).
- - How many electrons are in a Lewis structure?
  - Put electron pairs about each atom such that there are 8 electrons around each atom (octet rule), with the exception of H, which is only surrounded by 2 electrons.
- - What is octet rule?
  - The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that reflects the theory that main-group elements tend to bond in such a way that each atom has eight electrons in its valence shell, giving it the same electronic configuration as a noble gas.
- - How do we apply octet rule?
  - A stable arrangement is attended when the atom is surrounded by eight electrons. This octet can be made up by own electrons and some electrons which are shared. Thus, an atom continues to form bonds until an octet of electrons is made. This is known as octet rule by Lewis.
- - How do you know if something follows the octet rule?
  - The octet rule is only applicable to the main group elements. The molecules of the halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are known to obey the octet rule. In general, the elements that obey this rule include the s-block elements and the p-block elements (except hydrogen, helium, and lithium).
- - How do you find bond pairs and lone pairs?
  - Find the number of lone pairs on the central atom by subtracting the number of valence electrons on bonded atoms (Step 2) from the total number of valence electrons (Step 1). Divide the number of VEs not in bonds (from Step 3) by 2 to find the number of LPs.
- - Why oxygen has 2 lone pairs?
  - As only two bonded groups remain, two lone pairs exist. In the outer shell, oxygen with no bonds has 6 electrons, and it would like to have eight. Oxygen with four bonds will have four neighbours' electrons, so it has to shed two of its own six to get to 8.
- - What is an unshared pair of electrons?
  - A lone pair refers to a pair of valence electrons that are not shared with another atom in a covalent bond and is sometimes called an unshared pair or non-bonding pair. Lone pairs are found in the outermost electron shell of atoms. They can be identified by using a Lewis structure.
- - What causes a polar bond?
  - A polar bond is a type of covalent bond. A bond between two or more atoms is polar if the atoms have significantly different electronegativities (>0.4). Polar bonds do not share electrons equally, meaning the negative charge from the electrons is not evenly distributed in the molecule. This causes a dipole moment.
- - How many electrons are in covalent bond?
  - The sharing of electrons between atoms is called a covalent bond, and the two electrons that join atoms in a covalent bond are called a bonding pair of electrons.
- - Can carbon have lone pairs?
  - Carbon tends to form 4 bonds and have no lone pairs. Nitrogen tends to form three bonds and have on e lone pair. Oxygen tends to form two bonds and have two lone pairs. Fluorine (and all halogens) tends to form one bond and have 3 lone pairs.
- - Which is stronger a covalent or ionic bond?
  - onic bonds result from the mutual attraction between oppositely charged ions. They tend to be stronger than covalent bonds due to the coulombic attraction between ions of opposite charges.
- - How many electrons are in a double bond?
  - A double bond is a covalent bond between two atoms involving four bonding electrons as opposed to two in a single bond.
- - How do you determine polar and nonpolar?
  - If the difference in electronegativity for the atoms in a bond is greater than 0.4, we consider the bond polar. If the difference in electronegativity is less than 0.4, the bond is essentially nonpolar. If there are no polar bonds, the molecule is nonpolar.
- - What do we call a molecule without any dipole moment?
  - A molecule which has no net dipole moment is called non-polar. In non-polar molecule, the centres of positive and negative charges coincide.
- - Are double bonds PI or Sigma?
  - single bonds between atoms are always sigma bonds. Double bonds are comprised of one sigma and one pi bond. Triple bonds are comprised of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.
- - What makes a hydrogen bond?
  - Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom. It results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as a N, O, or F atom and another very electronegative atom.
- - What are the different types of hydrogen bonding?
  - Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond. An intramolecular hydrogen bond occurs within a single molecule. Intermolecular Hydrogen Bond. An intermolecular hydrogen bond occurs between two or more separate molecules in a substance.
- - How do you identify a hydrogen bond?
  - To recognize the possibility of hydrogen bonding, examine the Lewis structure of the molecule. The electronegative atom must have one or more unshared electron pairs as in the case of oxygen and nitrogen, and has a negative partial charge.
- - Are hydrogen bonds strong or weak?
  - Hydrogen bonds can vary in strength from very weak (1–2 kJ/mol) to extremely strong (over 155 kJ/mol) [20]. The length of hydrogen bonds depends on bond strength, temperature, and pressure. The bond strength itself is dependent on temperature, pressure, bond angle, and environment.
- - How are hydrogen bonds broken?
  - Hydrogen bonds are not strong bonds, but they make the water molecules stick together. The bonds cause the water molecules to associate strongly with one another. But these bonds can be broken by simply adding another substance to the water.
- - Why does hydrogen bonding occur in water?
  - Since the molecules of water are small, many of them can surround one solvent molecule and form hydrogen bonds. Between the hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom of a neighbouring water molecule, a hydrogen bond in water exists.
- - What is hydrogen bond with examples?
  - Water is an excellent example of hydrogen bonding. The bond is between the hydrogen of one water molecule and the oxygen atoms of another water molecule, not between the two hydrogen atoms (a common misconception).
- - What do hydrogen bonds do?
  - Hydrogen bonds are responsible for holding such materials as paper and felted wool together, and for causing separate sheets of paper to stick together after becoming wet and subsequently drying. The hydrogen bond is responsible for many of the abnormal physical and chemical properties of compounds of N, O, and F.
- - Why are hydrogen bonds important in water?
  - This sticking together of like substances is called cohesion. Depending on how attracted molecules of the same substance are to one another, the substance will be more or less cohesive. Hydrogen bonds cause water to be exceptionally attracted to each other.
- - Why is a hydrogen bond weak?
  - Because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ– charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule.
- - What properties do hydrogen bonds give water?
  - Water molecules are polar, so they form hydrogen bonds. This gives water unique properties, such as a relatively high boiling point, high specific heat, cohesion, adhesion and density.
- - What is the weakest bond?
  - the 4 different types of chemical bonds, ionic bonds are known to be the strongest and the bonds formed via Van der Waals forces are known to be the weakest. The ranking is, Ionic bond > Covalent bond > hydrogen bond > Van der Waals forces.
- - Why are triple bonds stronger?
  - A double bond and a triple bond are stronger than single bond because they hold the atoms closer and makes it harder to break these bonds.
- - Is co2 ionic or covalent?
  - CO2 is not an ionic compound. As per the definition, an ionic compound is a compound that is mostly formed between a metal atom and a non-metal atom. Meanwhile, CO2 is a compound that is formed between two non-metal atoms (carbon and oxygen) thus giving it a covalent nature.
- - Which bond is stronger sigma or pi?
  - Since the information of a sigma bond, the orbitals are along internuclear axis this results in more effective orbital overlap as compared to when pi bonds are formed as they are perpendicular to the internuclear axis. This significant difference in orbital overlap results in sigma bond being stronger than the pi bond.
- - Why covalent bonds are weak?
  - This is because the atoms within the covalent molecules are very tightly held together. Each molecule is indeed quite separate and the force of attraction between the individual molecules in a covalent compound tends to be weak. We require very little energy in separating the molecules.
- - How is a delta bond created?
  - Delta bond is a type of chemical bond where four lobes of one involved atomic orbital tend to overlap with four lobes of another involved atomic orbital to form this bond.
- - What causes hydrogen bonding between water molecules?
  - Hydrogen bonds are attractions of electrostatic force caused by the difference in charge between slightly positive hydrogen ions and other, slightly negative ions. In the case of water, hydrogen bonds form between neighboring hydrogen and oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules.
- - Are Delta bonds strong?
  - Delta bonds are formed by sideways overlap of four lobes of d-orbitals. Delta bonds are weaker than sigma bonds but stronger than pi bonds.
- - Which bond is stronger sigma or pi or Delta?
  - sigma bond is stronger. This is because sigma bond is formed by head-on overlapping of atomic orbitals and therefore, the overlapping is large. pi bond is formed by sideway overlapping which is small.
- - What does ∆ mean in chemistry?
  - A symbol which indicates that an atom or region with a deficiency of electron density, often because of resonance delocalization, electronegativity differences, or inductive effects.
- - When can you break the octet rule?
  - The Octet Rule is violated in these three scenarios, When there are an odd number of valence electrons. When there are too few valence electrons. When there are too many valence electrons.
- - Why do 8 electrons form a stable shell?
  - Atoms with 8 electrons in their valence shell have completely filled last orbitals and are therefore the most stable, as their electronic configuration is similar to that of the closest noble gas.
- - Why do atoms want octets?
  - Atoms follow the octet rule because they always seek the most stable electron configuration. Following the octet rule results in completely filled s- and p- orbitals in an atom's outermost energy level. Low atomic weight elements (the first 20 elements) are most likely to adhere to the octet rule.
- - How does kc change when reaction is reversed?
  - The equilibrium expression written for a reaction written in the reverse direction is the reciprocal of the one for the forward reaction. K' is the constant for the reverse reaction and K is that of the forward reaction.
- - What happens to KC when reaction is reversed and doubled?
  - For a reversible reaction, even if the concentration of the reactants is doubled, the value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction will remain the same.
- - Is KC the same for forward and backward reaction?
  - The Kc is representative of both the forward and reverse reactions because they reaction rates are reciprocals of one another.
- - Is the rate constant of the forward and reverse reaction equal?
  - The rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction. No further changes occur in the concentrations of reactants and products, even though the two reactions continue at equal but opposite rates.
- - What can cause a change in the value of the equilibrium constant of a reversible reaction?
  - The only thing that changes an equilibrium constant is a change of temperature. The position of equilibrium may be changed if you change the pressure.
- - What effect does reversing the reactants and products have on the value of the equilibrium constant?
  - All reactions tend towards a state of chemical equilibrium, the point at which both the forward process and the reverse process are taking place at the same rate. Since the forward and reverse rates are equal, the concentrations of the reactants and products are constant at equilibrium.
- - How KC is used to predict the extent of a reversible reaction?
  - Value of Kc is also used to predict the extent to which a reaction occurs. To predict the direction of reaction, The value of Kc is helpful in determining the direction in which a reaction will shift in order to achieve the equilibrium.
- - Is molar mass the same as formula mass?
  - The key difference between formula mass and molar mass is that, the formula mass of a molecule or a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in its empirical formula while molar mass is the mass in grams
- - How does the concentration affect the equilibrium?
  - If the concentration of a substance is changed, the equilibrium will shift to minimise the effect of that change. If the concentration of a reactant is increased the equilibrium will shift in the direction of the reaction that uses the reactants, so that the reactant concentration decreases.
- - How does stoichiometry of solutions affect life?
  - Stoichiometry is at the heart of the production of many things you use in your daily life. Soap, tires, fertilizer, gasoline, deodorant, and chocolate bars are just a few commodities you use that are chemically engineered, or produced through chemical reactions.
- - Does the reaction dependable on the limiting reagent?
  - Once this reagent is consumed the reaction stops. An excess reagent is the reactant that is left over once the limiting reagent is consumed. The maximum theoretical yield of a chemical reaction is dependent upon the limiting reagent thus the one that produces the least amount of product is the limiting reagent.

- - What is difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous?
  - A homogenous mixture is that mixture in which the components mix with each other and its composition is uniform throughout the solution. A heterogenous mixture is that mixture in which the composition is not uniform throughout and different components are observed.
- - What does homogeneous consists of?
  - Homogeneous most generally means consisting of parts or elements that are all the same. Something that is homogeneous is uniform in nature or character throughout. Homogeneous can also be used to describe multiple things that are all essentially alike or of the same kind.
- - What is non homogeneous substance?
  - made up of different types of people or things , not homogeneous nonhomogeneous neighborhoods the nonhomogenous atmosphere of the planet a nonhomogenous distribution of particles.
- - How to shift equilibrium to the right?
  - if we add reactant, equilibrium goes right, away from the reactant. If we add product, equilibrium goes left, away from the product. If we remove product, equilibrium goes right, making product. If we remove reactant, equilibrium goes left, making reactant.
- - How do you shift the equilibrium of a right reaction?
  - According to the Le Chatelier's principle, the net reaction will move in the direction that decreases the stress placed on the system. So if the stress is increased amount of one of the reactants, the equilibrium will shift to the right to get rid of some of that reactant.
- - What direction will the equilibrium shift when the pressure increases?
  - When there is an increase in pressure, the equilibrium will shift towards the side of the reaction with fewer moles of gas. When there is a decrease in pressure, the equilibrium will shift towards the side of the reaction with more moles of gas.
- - How do you shift an endothermic reaction to the right?
  - Increasing the temperature of an exothermic reaction would shift the reaction to the left, while increasing the temperature of an endothermic reaction would lead to a rightward shift.
- - What is a conjugate pair?
  - a conjugate pair is a pair of numbers whose product is an expression of real integers and/or including variables.
- - What does it means by conjugate acid?
  - A conjugate acid, within the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, is a chemical compound formed when an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base—in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it, as in the reverse reaction it loses a hydrogen ion.
- - What is pH and its formula?
  - The equation for calculating pH was proposed in 1909 by Danish biochemist Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen, pH = -log[H+] where log is the base-10 logarithm and [H+] stands for the hydrogen ion concentration in units of moles per liter solution.
- - What is pH full form?
  - The full form of pH is Potential of Hydrogen. pH is known as the negative logarithm of H+ ion concentration. Hence the meaning of the name pH is explained as the strength of hydrogen. pH describes the concentration of the hydrogen ions in a solution and it is the indicator of acidity or basicity of the solution.
- - What is the difference between dipole dipole interaction and hydrogen bonding?
  - Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom. It results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as a N, O, or F atom and another very electronegative atom.
- - What is the difference between the dipole dipole interactions London dispersion forces and hydrogen bond?
  - The main difference between dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces is that dipole-dipole forces occur among molecules with dipole moment whereas London dispersions occur due to instantaneous dipoles that form in atoms or nonpolar molecules.
- - What is hydrogen bonding intermolecular forces?
  - Hydrogen bonding is an intermolecular force which occurs between two molecules which have a hydrogen atom directly bonded to a nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine atom.
- - Is a hydrogen bond a dipole-dipole?
  - Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole attraction between molecules, not a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom. It results from the attractive force between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as a N, O, or F atom and another very electronegative atom.
- - What can hydrogen bond?
  - Any molecule which has a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen or a nitrogen is capable of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonds also occur when hydrogen is bonded to fluorine, but the HF group does not appear in other molecules.
- - Is hydrogen bonding polar or nonpolar?
  - The positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to negative atoms (nitrogen, hydrogen, or fluorine) in nearby molecules. These bonds are extremely polar because of the high electronegativity difference between the atoms.
- - Do all polar molecules have hydrogen bonding?
  - The hydrogen bond in polar molecules occurs only in compounds that have hydrogen bonded to N, O, or F. These very highly electronegative elements create a partial positive charge on the hydrogen. The H atom is attracted to the partial negative charge on an N, O, or F atom in another molecule.
- - Are hydrogen bonds hydrophobic or hydrophilic?
  - Nonpolar molecules that repel the water molecules are said to be hydrophobic; molecules forming ionic or a hydrogen bond with the water molecule are said to be hydrophilic.
- - What is hydrophilic?
  - having a tendency to mix with, dissolve in, or be wetted by water.
- - What is the connection between polarity and hydrogen bonds?
  - Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between them, forming hydrogen bonds.
- - What is the difference between Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions?
  - The key difference between Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions is that Van der Waals interactions are attraction forces between non-polar molecules, whereas hydrophobic interactions are repulsion forces between water molecules and other molecules.
- - Why is hydrogen bonding the strongest intermolecular force?
  - Hydrogen bonding is so strong among dipole-dipole interactions because it itself is a dipole-dipole interaction with one of the strongest possible electrostatic attractions. Remember that hydrogen bonding cannot occur unless hydrogen is covalently bonded to either oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine.
- - What causes dipole interactions?
  - Dipole-dipole interaction arises due to the uneven distribution of electrons in a molecule. The electrons congregate at one end of the molecule. Thus, the molecule acquires a partially negative charge at one end and a partial positive charge at the other end, thus making them polar.
- - Can nonpolar molecules have dipole-dipole interactions?
  - In the case of non-polar molecules, dispersion forces or London forces are present between them. These forces are induced dipole - induced dipole interactions.
- - Why is hydrogen bonding not a van der Waals forces?
  - Van der Waals forces can occur between two permanent dipoles, dipole- induced dipole, or two induced dipoles. For Van der Waals forces to take place, the molecule should not necessarily have a dipole, but Hydrogen bonding takes place between two permanent dipoles.
- - What type of bond is van der Waals?
  - A weak attractive force between atoms or nonpolar molecules caused by a temporary change in dipole moment arising from a brief shift of orbital electrons to one side of one atom or molecule, creating a similar shift in adjacent atoms or molecules.
- - Are van der Waals forces intermolecular or intramolecular?
  - Van der Waals forces are a category of intermolecular forces that includes London dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions. Some sources also consider hydrogen bonding to be a Van der Waals force.
- - What are the difference between the types of intermolecular forces?
  - Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature and include van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds. Molecules in liquids are held to other molecules by intermolecular interactions, which are weaker than the intramolecular interactions that hold the atoms together within molecules and polyatomic ions.
- - What is irreversible and reversible reaction?
  - Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. The reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions. The reactants can change to the products, and the products can also change back to the reactants.
- - What is the difference between reversible and irreversible?
  - Reversible Changes are those changes that can be reversed easily to form the 'original substance'. 1. Irreversible changes are those changes where materials cannot be changed back to its original form.
- - What is this symbol ⇌ used to represent?
  - The symbol ⇌ has two half arrowheads, one pointing in each direction. It is used in equations that show reversible reactions, the forward reaction is the one that goes to the right. the backward reaction is the one that goes to the left.
- - Why is liquid incompressible?
  - Since the amount of the liquid is almost unchanged, the fluid density (kg/m3) is constant. Liquids are always considered to be incompressible fluids, as density changes caused by pressure and temperature are small.
- - How can the concentration be changed?
  - Concentration can also be changed by removing a substance from the reaction. This is often accomplished by adding another substance that reacts (in a side reaction) with something already in the reaction.
- - How can the concentration of a solution be changed?
  - The concentration of a solution can be changed, concentration can be increased by dissolving more solute in a given volume of solution - this increases the mass of the solute. concentration can be increased by allowing some of the solvent to evaporate - this decreases the volume of the solution.
- - What affects concentration?
  - Reactant concentration, the physical state of the reactants, and surface area, temperature, and the presence of a catalyst are the four main factors that affect reaction rate.
- - What effect do concentration changes have on the reaction rate?
  - Increasing the concentration of reactants generally increases the rate of reaction because more of the reacting molecules or ions are present to form the reaction products. This is especially true when concentrations are low and few molecules or ions are reacting.
- - What changes the rate of a reaction?
  - In general, increasing the concentration of a reactant in solution, increasing the surface area of a solid reactant, and increasing the temperature of the reaction system will all increase the rate of a reaction. A reaction can also be sped up by adding a catalyst to the reaction mixture.
- - How is concentration related to rate?
  - The rate is proportional to the concentration of a reactant. When you double the concentration the rate doubles. The rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of a reactant. When you double the concentration the rate goes up four times.
- - How do you determine concentration?
  - Divide the mass of the solute by the total volume of the solution. Write out the equation C = m/V, where m is the mass of the solute and V is the total volume of the solution. Plug in the values you found for the mass and volume, and divide them to find the concentration of your solution.
- - How does the limiting reactant affect the product?
  - A limiting reagent is a chemical reactant that limits the amount of product that is formed. The limiting reagent gives the smallest yield of product calculated from the reagents (reactants) available. This smallest yield of product is called the theoretical yield.
- - What affects the concentration of ions?
  - The concentration of ions in solution depends on the mole ratio between the dissolved substance and the cations and anions it forms in solution. Sodium chloride dissociates into Na+ cations and Cl− anions when dissolved in water.
- - What determines the effect of limiting reagent on the mass of a product?
  - The key to recognizing which reactant is the limiting reagent is based on a mole-mass or mass-mass calculation, whichever reactant gives the lesser amount of product is the limiting reagent.
- - How does the pH of a substance relate to the ion concentration?
  - The overall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on the pH scale (Figure 1). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher the pH.
- - How does a pi bond form?
  - A pi bond (π bond) is a bond formed by the overlap of orbitals in a side-by-side fashion with the electron density concentrated above and below the plane of the nuclei of the bonding atoms.
- - Why do p orbitals form pi bonds?
  - π bonds are formed because the side-by-side overlap of p orbitals leads to a lower-energy state than if there were no overlap.
- - Which orbitals form a pi π bond?
  - π bonds are those with one node that is in-plane with the internuclear axis. π bonds can for between two d orbitals or between d orbitals and other types of orbitals with comparable symmetry. An example of a π bond between two d orbitals is that formed by two dxz orbitals along the z axis.
- - What does the pH of a solution measure relate your answer to the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions?
  - The pH scale is usually represented as ranging from 0 to 14. Values of pH lower than 7 indicate that the hydrogen ion concentration is greater than the hydroxide ion concentration, and the aqueous solution is termed acidic.
- - What is meant by the limiting reactant and how does it affects a chemical reaction?
  - The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that gets consumed first in a chemical reaction and therefore limits how much product can be formed.
- - How does Le Chatelier's principle explain the common ion effect?
  - Le Chatelier's Principle states that if an equilibrium becomes unbalanced, the reaction will shift to restore the balance. If a common ion is added to a weak acid or weak base equilibrium, then the equilibrium will shift towards the reactants, in this case the weak acid or base.
- - How does ionic strength affect equilibrium?
  - As the ionic strength increases, an ion loses some of its effectiveness, and its activity coefficient decreases. In solutions that are not too concentrated, the activity coefficient for a given species is independent of the nature of the electrolyte and dependent only on the ionic strength.
- - What is the relationship between pH and H+ concentration?
  - The pH scale is a logarithmic scale based on the concentration of hydrogen ions. The higher the H+ ion concentration is, the lower the pH of the solution.

  - The limiting reactant (or limiting reagent) is the reactant that gets consumed first in a chemical reaction and therefore limits how much product can be formed.
- - How does a limiting reactant impact the amount of a product that is collected?
  - A limiting reagent is a chemical reactant that limits the amount of product that is formed. The limiting reagent gives the smallest yield of product calculated from the reagents (reactants) available. This smallest yield of product is called the theoretical yield.
- - How do common ions affect chemical equilibrium?
  - Adding a common ion decreases solubility, as the reaction shifts toward the left to relieve the stress of the excess product. Adding a common ion to a dissociation reaction causes the equilibrium to shift left, toward the reactants, causing precipitation.
- - What is the definition of a common ion as it applies to Le Chatelier's?
  - An ion that is present in an equilibrium system and a compound added to the system.
- - What factors contribute to greater ionic strength?
  - The strength of the ionic bond is directly dependent upon the quantity of the charges and inversely dependent on the distance between the charged particles. A cation with a 2+ charge will make a stronger ionic bond than a cation with a 1+ charge.
- - Does lower pH mean higher concentration of H+?
  - The pH value of a solution directly measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. Acids have a large H+ concentration, which translates to a small pH value. Bases have very little H+. Basic solutions have large pH values - greater than pH 7.

  - Law of chemical Equilibrium states that. The ratio of product of concentration of. Products to product of concentration of. Reactants, each term raised to power of. Their stoichiometric coefficient in a balanced.
- - Is KC only for gas?
  - Kp is the equilibrium constant given as a ratio between the pressure of products and reactants. Kc can be used for gaseous or liquid reaction mixtures.
- - Does pressure change KC?
  - Kc and Kp are. constants for a reaction. They dont get affected by changing volume or pressure.
- - Why do solids not affect equilibrium?
  - Pure solids or liquids are excluded from the equilibrium expression because their effective concentrations stay constant throughout the reaction. The concentration of a pure liquid or solid equals its density divided by its molar mass.
- - How to avoid systematic error?
  - Systematic error can be minimized by routinely calibrating equipment, using controls in experiments, warming up instruments prior to taking readings, and comparing values against standards. While random errors can be minimized by increasing sample size and averaging data, it's harder to compensate for systematic error.
- - What are ways to eliminate systematic error?
  - Systematic error arises from equipment, so the most direct way to eliminate it is to use calibrated equipment, and eliminate any zero or parallax errors. Even if your measurements are affected, some systematic errors can be eliminated in the data analysis.
- - What can we do to minimize random and systematic errors?
  - While you can't eradicate it completely, you can reduce random error by taking repeated measurements, using a large sample, and controlling extraneous variables. You can avoid systematic error through careful design of your sampling, data collection, and analysis procedures.
- - Can we eliminate systematic error?
  - Systematic error, as stated above, can be eliminated—not totally, but usually to a sufficient degree. Calibration is simply a procedure where the result of measurement recorded by an instrument is compared with the measurement result of a standard.
- - How can you minimize error in an experiment?
  - Double check all measurements for accuracy. Double check your formulas are correct.Make sure observers and measurement takers are well trained. Make the measurement with the instrument that has the highest precision.Take the measurements under controlled conditions.
- - Can bases conduct electricity?
  - Bases also conduct electricity in aqueous solution. Bases are also electrolytes that give ions in aqueous solutions and these ions help to conduct electricity.
- - Can alkali conduct electricity?
  - Acidic and alkaline solutions can conduct electricity because they have ions that are free to carry charge.
- - What are properties of bases?
  - Bases change the colour of litmus from red to blue. They are bitter in taste. Bases lose their basicity when mixed with acids. Bases react with acids to form salt and water. They can conduct electricity.Bases feel slippery or soapy.Some bases are great conductors of electricity.
- - What are properties of acids?
  - Acids taste sour, conduct electricity when dissolved in water, and react with metals to produce hydrogen gas. Certain indicator compounds, such as litmus, can be used to detect acids. Acids turn blue litmus paper red. The strength of acids is measured on the pH scale.
- - Why do bases taste bitter?
  - bases are organic compounds with basic groups containing nitrogen, like aminogroups or heterocyclic nitrogen. They are often potentially poisonous alkaloids, so evolution came with unpleasant sensation for such compounds. The typical example is quite bitter caffeine.
- - Is a base a salt?
  - A substance is called base if its aqueous solution tastes bitter, turns red litmus blue, or neutralizes acids. Salt is a neutral substance whose aqueous solution does not affect litmus.
- - Can a base dissolve in water?
  - Bases can be either water soluble or insoluble. Insoluble bases react with acids, directly dissolving in the acid as they react.
- - What are some insoluble bases?
  - Ca(OH)2 (calcium hydroxide), Mg(OH)2 (magnesium hydroxide) MgO (magnesium oxide) and zinc oxide (ZnO)
- - What are some soluble bases?
  - Common examples include sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate (sodium bicarbonate), sodium hypochlorite and ammonia.
- - What is the name of an insoluble base?
  - Bases insoluble in water are called 'alkalis'.
- - How can you make a buffer more effective?
  - The most effective buffers contain equal concentrations of an acid and its conjugate base. A buffer that contains approximately equal amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base in solution is equally effective at neutralizing either added base or added acid.
- - How do you increase the buffer capacity of buffer?
  - The capacity of a buffer to neutralize added acid or base depends on the concentrations of HA and A⁻ in solution. For a given ratio of [HA] to [A⁻], the greater the concentrations, the higher the overall buffer capacity. When [HA] is greater than [A⁻], the capacity is higher for added base than acid.
- - What factors influence the effectiveness of a buffer?
  - The goal of a buffer is to keep the pH of a solution within a narrow range. While the ratio of [A-]/[HA] influences the pH of a solution, the actual concentrations of A- and HA influence the effectiveness of a buffer.
- - How do buffers resist change in pH?
  - Buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH, upon addition of small amounts of acid or base. The can do this because they contain an acidic component, HA, to neutralize OH- ions, and a basic component, A-, to neutralize H+ ions. Since Ka is a constant, the [H+] will depend directly on the ratio of [HA]/[A-].
- - Does temperature affect buffer capacity?
  - The slops and position of pH, log Pco, buffer lines are altered by changes in temperature. At reduced temperatures the buffering capacity is increased, so that the addition of acid or alkali gave rise to smaller changes in pH.
- - How does temperature affect pH of buffers?
  - pH is based on the concentration of free H+ in solution. As the temperature increases the bonds holding the protons are broken and the pH increases.
- - Why is buffering capacity important?
  - Buffer capacity is a quantitative measure of resistance to pH change upon the addition of H+ or OH- ions. It is important for river water to maintain a stable pH such that the local ecosystems are preserved in order to keep Columbus flourishing.
- - What happens to pH when temperature increases?
  - pH decreases with increase in temperature. But this does not mean that water becomes more acidic at higher temperatures. A solution is considered as acidic if there is an excess of hydrogen ions over hydroxide ions.
- - Does pressure affect pH?
  - In basic solutions, the pH value increases with increasing pressure (e.g. NH3 in water) and in acidic solutions it decreases (e.g. SO2 in water).
- - Why alcohols do not react with bases?
  - The reason is also correct the ethoxide ion is the stronger base than hydroxide ion. Because of the aq. NaOH when reacts with water forms ethoxide ion but due to its basicity it abstract hydrogen reforming alcohol. hence alcohols does not reacts with the base.
- - What happens when an alcohol reacts with a strong base?
  - When an alcohol is deprotonated by a base, it turns into an alkoxide anion with a negative charge on the oxygen.
- - Why alcohol is Lewis base?
  - Alcohol acts as a lewis base due to the presence of lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom in alcohol.
- - How do lone pairs affect polarity?
  - Lone pairs contribute to localize negative charge on an atom. The effect of lone pairs alone is why the T‐shaped molecule I4 is polar, even though each bond is none polar. Lone pairs can either enhance or diminish the contribution of bond dipoles to the polarity of a molecule.
- - Does lone pair always mean polar?
  - It is often true that if a molecule has a lone pair, it is also polar. However, a molecule can have lone pair(s) and not be polar.
- - How do lone pairs affect electronegativity?
  - The lone pair is generally resided on the other side of the bond. These electrons are a part of oxygen and these makes oxygen more electronegative because of which the dipole moment increases ans hence the bond becomes stronger.
- - What are the effect of lone pairs?
  - Lone pairs have the greatest repelling effect because they are closer to the nucleus of the central atom compared to the bonding pairs, therefore they repel other lone pairs greater compared to bonding pairs.
- - Do lone pairs have an effect on dipole moment?
  - Lone pair electrons have effect on the net dipole moment of a molecule. A dipole moment is the product of the magnitude of the partial charges on the molecule and the distance in which they are separated. Lone pair electrons affect both the partial charges and the distance between partial charges.
- - Why does the presence of lone pair electrons contribute to the polarity of a water molecule?
  - In the covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the oxygen atom attracts electrons a bit more strongly than the hydrogen atoms. The unequal sharing of electrons gives the water molecule a slight negative charge near its oxygen atom and a slight positive charge near its hydrogen atoms.
- - How does lone pair affect bond length?
  - Lone Pairs of electrons on neighboring atoms weaken the bond because of electron repulsion. Neighboring atoms in a molecule that have lone pair electrons will not be held together in their bond as tightly because the lone pair electrons of both atoms repel each another.
- - What is orbital dipole moment due to lone pair?
  - Orbital dipole of lonepair is the dipole between positively charged nucleus and negatively charged loanpair orbital, which is in the direction of the lonepair orbital.
- - How much do lone pairs affect bond angles?
  - Lone pairs are in orbitals that are shorter and rounder than the orbitals that the bonding pairs occupy. Because of this, there is more repulsion between a lone pair and a bonding pair than there is between two bonding pairs. That forces the bonding pairs together slightly - reducing the bond angle from 109.5° to 107°.
- - What is difference between lone pair and bond pair?
  - The main difference between bond pair and lone pair is that bond pair is composed of two electrons that are in a bond whereas lone pair is composed of two electrons that are not in a bond.
- - What is the relationship between number of bonds and lone pairs an atom forms has to group number?
  - The number of non-bonding electrons is equal to the the number of electrons in a full valence shell minus the number electrons which are participating in bonding (which is 2 x the typical number of bonds). The number of lone pairs is the number of non-bonding electrons divided by two.
- - What are binary compounds?
  - A binary phase or binary compound is a chemical compound containing two different elements. Some binary phase compounds are molecular, e.g. carbon tetrachloride. More typically binary phase refers to extended solids.
- - What is the difference between ionic compound and binary compound?
  - The key difference between ionic and binary compounds is that ionic compounds contain two charged components whereas binary compounds contain two different chemical elements.19 Sept 2019
- - How are binary compounds formed?
  - A binary compound is a compound formed from two different elements. There may or may not be more than one of each element. A diatomic compound (or diatomic molecule) contains two atoms, which may or may not be the same. Metals combine with nonmetals to give ionic compounds.
- - How do you increase solubility?
  - an increase in the temperature of the solution increases the solubility of a solid solute. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. A few solid solutes, however, are less soluble in warmer solutions.
- - Do electrolytes contain electrons?
  - There are no electrons in the electrolyte; electricity transfer through an electrolyte is due to a charge transfer of positively charged ions (cations) moving away from the anode and toward the cathode, while negatively charged ions (anions) move away from the cathode and toward the anode.
- - What is electrolyte made of?
  - Electrolytes are minerals such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium. They are present in tissue, blood, and other bodily fluids and are critical for nerve and muscle function, blood pressure regulation, and hydration.
- - What are the 3 main electrolytes?
  - The major electrolytes, sodium, potassium, and chloride.
- - How are binary compounds named?
  - Binary ionic compounds are named by writing the metal ion first, followed by the nonmetal. If the metal has only one ion, then the Roman numeral is not necessary.
- - What do lone pairs repel?
  - Bond angles will deviate from their ideal values according to the rule that lone pairs repel other electrons more strongly than bonding pairs. Although lone pairs are clearly smaller than atoms, they need to be closer to the nucleus of an atom than a bonding pair.
- - Why do lone pairs repel more?
  - Bonding electrons are further away from the nucleus, but they are more localized, so they are not as spread out. This is why two lone pairs will exhibit more repulsion that one lone pair and one bond pair, which in turn will exhibit more repulsion than two bond pairs.
- - Why do lone pairs of electrons create greater repulsion?
  - Bonding pairs are stabilized between two atoms. Since there's no atom on the other end of a lone pair, it spreads out more than would be if it were in a bond. Lone pairs therefore repel more because the charge density is spread out more, that is, it's bigger.
- - Do lone pair electrons repel each other?
  - Yes, lone pairs repel each other. Lone pair of electrons are the electrons in the valence shell that are not shared with another atom. Lone pairs do not form covalent bonds. Two lone pairs of electrons will repel each other because they both have negative charges
